<p class="title">Recycling</p>

<p>The ever-growing number of vehicles being scrapped each year
means that the environmentally-friendly recycling of vehicle
components is an issue of major and increasing importance.</p>

<p>One of the most important principles for economical recycling is
the use of easily separable materials for a given part or module.
When scrapping old cars or parts in the future, this will permit
parts made of the same materials to be grouped together. Opel has
followed this principle for many years and, in 1979, became the
first German automobile manufacturer to mark all parts made of
synthetic materials with internationally standardised materials
symbols, indicting the synthetic material used in each case.
Recyclable plastic parts can be separated out and grouped together
by checking their materials symbol.</p>
