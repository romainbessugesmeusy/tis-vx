<p class="topic">Double-wishbone axle</p>

<p>The double-wishbone axle is mainly used on the front axle. On
very sporting vehicles, this form of axle is also sometimes used on
the rear.</p>

<p>The suspension arms are normally triangular. Therefore they are
also called wishbones. The wishbones are mounted on the axle body
or vehicle body in two rotary joints, while the outer corner is
held by the steering knuckle at the top and bottom. The connecting
elements between the steering knuckle and wishbone are usually ball
joints. The purpose of these joints is to allow the vertical
movements of the steering knuckle on springing, and horizontal
movement on steering.</p>

<p>The advantages of double wishbone axles is the very precise
wheel guide and multiple adjustment possibilities. Depending on
arrangement (e.g. symmetrical arrangement, tilt change) or change
in length ratio (trapezoidal link) of the wishbones, various
driving properties can be influenced positively.</p>

<p class="topic">Spring strut type axle (MacPherson)</p>

<p>The development of the McPherson-spring strut-axle is based on
the design of the double-wishbone axle. The upper wishbone has been
replaced by a complete spring strut. The lower part of spring strut
is connected directly to the steering knuckle (welded or screwed),
the upper part is screwed onto the vehicle body (dome). The lower
crossmember in the double-wishbone axle is retained in the
McPherson-spring strut-axle.</p>

<p>The following depicts the different spring strut type axles used
in Opel/Vauxhall vehicles.</p>
