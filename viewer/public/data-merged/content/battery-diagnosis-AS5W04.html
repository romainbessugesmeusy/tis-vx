<p class="topic">Battery test:</p>

<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Generally, the safety regulations of group N for vehicle batteries
must be observed.</p>

<p>The battery tester KM-J-42000-EU was introduced as dealership
equipment during this model year. It enables quick and reliable
determination of the current battery condition. This is important
for in-vehicle battery diagnosis as well as for the diagnosis of
stored batteries. For diagnosis of installed batteries, the use of
this tester does not require disconnection or removal of the
battery.After completion of the test, the battery tester indicates
the battery condition in the form of test result, output as plain
text. In addition, a test code is output for the purpose of result
summarisation for warranty cases.For these warranty cases, the
output test code must be hand-written on the warranty claim.The
safety regulations must be observed during the charging procedures
resulting from the test.The battery must be disconnected during
charging.</p>

<p class="topic">Note:</p>

<p>Due to "acid layering", a battery which has been charged with a
low charge voltage (≤ 14.9 V) may be evaluated as "good" by the
tester, even though the battery eye remains black. These batteries
must not be replaced, as the battery eye will change to "green"
during driving due to mixing of the battery fluid.</p>

<p><span class="gt-notice">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Storage:</p>

<p>Batteries which are stored for long periods must be recharged
approximately every six months.In the case of stored vehicles, the
ground connection must be disconnected and the battery must also be
recharged every six months.When using stored batteries, those with
the longest storage time must be used first.</p>
