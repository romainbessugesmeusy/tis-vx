<p class="title">What is the purpose of chassis alignment?</p>

<p>The theoretical wheel position is the position of the wheels
parallel to the direction of travel. However, with this wheel
position it is extremely difficult to keep the vehicle safely on
the road.</p>

<p>The wheel position is determined by:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Drive type (front/rear wheel drive)</li>

<li>Wheelbase</li>

<li>Track</li>

<li>Toe</li>

<li>Camber</li>

<li>Kingpin inclination</li>

<li>Castor</li>

<li>Offset radius</li>

<li>Toe variation</li>
</ul>

<p>The geometric position of the wheels ensures that the forces
acting on the wheel when the vehicle is being driven are taken into
account and hence a higher level of safety and good handling are
achieved.</p>

<p>Modern chassis designs are characterised by the following
properties:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Neutral steering and handling</li>

<li>Good straight-line stability (tracking stability)</li>

<li>Neutral cornering behaviour, i.e. a low degree of understeer or
oversteer due to the lateral stability of the wheels even with high
cornering speeds</li>

<li>Low steering effort and quick response from the steering</li>

<li>No disturbing influences on the steering wheel, such as impacts
or vibrations from high stresses, for example when braking or
accelerating or due to uneven road surfaces</li>

<li>no/little transfer of disruptive influences to the passenger
compartment</li>
</ul>

<p>The chassis alignment is used to check the geometric wheel
position specified by Opel/Vauxhall in order to guarantee safety
and good handling in many different types of driving conditions</p>
