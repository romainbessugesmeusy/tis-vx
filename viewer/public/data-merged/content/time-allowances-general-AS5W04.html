<p class="title">Time Allowances - General</p>

<p>For individual damage types, see section 2.1 "Repairable
Damage", time allowances have been compiled according to the number
of cables to be repaired or replaced.</p>

<p>To determine the time allowances, the operation number for
replacing the wiring harness concerned is used in conjunction with
TC: 87. TC: 87 here means a repair has been made.</p>

<p>Before starting the repair, it must be estimated whether it is
more economical to repair than to replace the wiring harness. To do
this, use the time allowances listed in section 6.2.</p>

<p>These only take into account the wiring harness repair itself.
Any preparation work needed to expose areas for repair are not
included in this and must be considered separately. For this
reason, we ask you, as is also recommended for customer invoices,
to list the time allowances given in section 6.2 plus those for the
preparatory operations and compare them with the time allowances
for replacing the entire wiring harness.</p>

<p>In warranty claims , the total time required (repair and
preparatory operations) is submitted with TC: 87 under the
operation number for the corresponding wring harness replacement,
and the total time required for the repair must not exceed the time
allowance for replacing the entire wiring harness. Slight amounts
exceeding the time allowance must be approved by entering the
voluntary code "Y". When calculating the most cost-effective method
in normal customer transactions , we recommend that the prices for
wiring harness and repair kit are also included.</p>

<p>The preparatory operations can be identified by normal main
operation numbers.</p>
