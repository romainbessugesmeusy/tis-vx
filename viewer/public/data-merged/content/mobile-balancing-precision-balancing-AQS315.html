<p class="title">Mobile Balancing (Precision Balancing)</p>

<p>After wheels have been installed on the vehicle, imbalances
could occur, usually causes by imbalances in rotating vehicle parts
(wheel hub, brake drum or brake disc). To compensate this residual
imbalance, balance the wheels on the vehicle with a mobile balancer
(finish balancer or precision balancer).</p>

<p>Electronic imbalance determination is performed using two
recorders (measuring stands) with integrated force sensors.</p>

<p>The recording points should be on the axle body, as close as
possible to the centre plane of the wheels. Always make sure that
there is a rigid metallic connection between the measuring stands
and suspension, i.e. do not place the measuring stand under rubber
bearings or shock absorber fastening lugs.</p>

<p class="topic">Caution !</p>

<p>The wheels on the drive axle must be driven by the vehicle's own
engine. The workplace must be equipped with an exhaust extraction
unit. To prevent damage, ensure that precision balancing is only
performed using the special measuring stands and suitable
adapters.</p>

<p>Differing running speeds or directions can cause interruptions
to the measurement procedure when precision balancers with
"infrared sensors and selective measuring procedures" are used.</p>

<p>Precision balancing of the rear wheels is always performed with
two measuring stands. To prevent damage to the differential, the
wheels may only be driven by the vehicle's engine.</p>

<p>At the front axle, the wheel which is to be balanced must be
driven by the balancing equipment friction wheel in direction of
travel. If only one measuring stand is used, the opposite vehicle
side does not have to be raised.</p>

<p>Front and rear axle support: In each case under the swivel joint
of the lower wishbone (use suitable adapter from balancer
manufacturer).</p>
