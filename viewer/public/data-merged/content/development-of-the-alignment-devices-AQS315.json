In the beginning, the position of\nthe wheels was determined using plumb lines, level gauges and\nmeasurement plates. Obviously, these measurement methods produced\nvery imprecise information on the wheel position, but this was\nadequate for the earlier rigid axles with steering knuckles and\nsteering knuckle pins.</p>\n\n<p>Further development of the chassis designs right up to the\nmodern multi-link suspension systems means it is now possible to\ndetermine the chassis geometry precisely, including rear axle\nalignment. This development has resulted in increased\nspecifications chassis alignment equipment in order to be able to\nperform satisfactory chassis alignment checks.</p>\n\n<p>For modern individual suspension, the mechanical and visual\nmeasurement methods are no longer adequate for precise chassis\nalignment and have not been approved by Opel/Vauxhall for all\nOpel/Vauxhall vehicles since the introduction of the Vectra-B. They\nhave been replaced by the modern computer-supported chassis\nalignment systems.</p>\n\n<p>Computer-aided chassis alignments equipment not only permit very\nprecise chassis alignments, they also save a lot of time.</p>\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  \r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td ></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
