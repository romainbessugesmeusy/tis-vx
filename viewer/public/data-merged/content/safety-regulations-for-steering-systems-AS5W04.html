<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Steering Systems</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>During operations where there is the risk of an electrical
short circuit, disconnect the ground cable from the battery.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Only Corsa-C as of Model Year 2004 and Meriva-A: In vehicles
with ESP, the steering angle sensor must be recalibrated after
disconnecting the battery - switch ignition ON and turn steering
wheel from the right to the left stop.</li>
</ul>

<li>Bolted connections with designated angle of rotation specified
in the Service Instructions (anti-fatigue bolts) must be replaced
with new parts if removed.</li>

<li>The inner thread of screw connections that have been used with
sealing compound must be recut and the outer thread cleaned. Used
screws with sealing compound. Always replace self-locking
nuts.</li>

<li>Never heat-treat steering components; potential alterations of
the material properties can otherwise adversely affect the
operational safety of the vehicle.</li>

<li>When working on the steering (steering gear, track rods,
steering column etc.) the steering must in the straight-ahead
position during removal and assembly.</li>

<li>When removing the steering wheel, lock the steering column in
the "straight ahead" position to avoid destroying the contact
unit/CIM during subsequent reinstallation of contact unit/CIM and
steering wheel.</li>

<li>If the driver airbag has been deployed, the steering wheel,
steering column and steering column attachment must be subjected to
a function test and inspection and replaced if damaged.</li>

<li>Only use approved special fluids – never re-use drained
fluid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following an accident, the following components should be
visually checked for bending and cracks, independently of the
chassis alignment check, which should always be performed:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The chassis and all related components, such as spring strut,
steering knuckle, control arm, axle body, stabilisers and
miscellaneous fastening parts.</li>

<li>Steering and steering linkage. In addition, check for correct
operation through the entire steering angle.</li>
</ul>
