<p class="title">Axle constructions - rear axle</p>

<p class="topic">Rigid axle</p>

<p>The rigid axle is characterised by very solid construction and
high load-bearing capacity. With regard to driving behaviour and
comfort, other axle designs such as the torsion beam and multilink
suspension are far better. As the main advantage of this axle
design is its load-bearing capacity, it is mainly used on goods
vehicles. Another advantage is the low-cost production, and the
totally constant castor and camber alignment over the entire
driving distance.</p>

<p class="topic">Torsion-beam rear axle</p>

<p>The torsion beam axle is another form of rigid axle. Torsion
beam axles include trailing arm axles which are often used on the
rear in simple designs. In direct comparison with individual
suspension, the trailing axle has the advantage that it is more
economic to produce, takes up less space and still has excellent
driving behaviour.</p>

<p>Trailing arm axles are particularly suitable for use of torsion
bar springs or profiles, as the control arms can easily be
connected to the spring ends. More stable running is achieved with
trailing arms as the control arms pull the wheels on forward
motion.</p>

<p class="topic">Multi-link suspension</p>

<p>Multilink axles are a form of individual suspension and try to
combine the benefits of trailing arm, semi-trailing arm and
wishbone axles. On the Vectra-C, as well as the axle body this
individual suspension has a upper and lower wishbones, where only
the upper one is designed as an auxiliary control arm, and a
trailing arm on each side. In addition on the Vectra-C there is an
antiroll bar and an auxiliary control arm at the bottom.</p>
