<p class="title">Safety regulations for gas-powered vehicles
(natural gas / LPG liquid gas)</p>

<p class="topic">7.1 General</p>

<p>The following danger notes and safety regulations exclusively
apply to maintenance and repair work on Opel vehicles.</p>

<p>Natural gas / liquid gas is a hazardous substance and must be
treated, stored and identified accordingly.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Natural gas is lighter than air and flows upwards when
released.</li>

<li>Liquid gas (LPG) is heavier than air and can collect in
depressions.</li>

<li>In combination with air, both gases form an explosive,
flammable mixture.</li>

<li>Concentrated natural gas can cause suffocation.</li>

<li>In most countries, an odour-producing agent is added to the gas
in order to give the gas a more intensive smell. This typical gas
smell can be detected when the gas concentration is still well
below the lower explosion limit (LEL). The odour-producing agent in
the gas does not pose a health hazard for the consumer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Natural gas-driven vehicles (CNG = Compressed Natural Gas) are
recognisable from the following features:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>In the vehicle documents (vehicle title document, vehicle
registration papers), "high-pressure gas" will be entered as the
type of drive system. The vehicle is regarded as monovalent because
an approximately 14 litre petrol tank is to be provided as an
emergency supply tank.</li>

<li>There are pressurised gas tanks, either individually or as a
module, beneath the vehicle</li>

<li>At the natural gas safety refuelling valve (TN1 combination)
behind the fuel tank cover.</li>

<li>On a sticker for the operating materials in the fuel tank
cap.</li>

<li>Additional identification plate next to the standard vehicle
identification plate sticker on the B-pillar.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>If, despite the fitting of gas storage equipment, there are no
stickers in the appropriate places, these must be applied.</li>

<li>On vehicles not driven by natural gas, these stickers must not
be present.</li>

<li>The issuing of loose stickers to final customers is not
permissible.</li>
</ul>

<li>From the logo "1.6 CNG", "CNG", "eco M", "eco M turbo",
"ecoflex", "ecoflex turbo".</li>

<li>Check Booklet in the additional Owner's Manual with the
on-board literature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vehicles with liquid gas drive (LPG = Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
can be identified from the following features:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>On the gas container or below the vehicle.</li>

<li>On the filler valve behind the fuel tank cover.</li>

<li>Additional identification plate next to the standard vehicle
identification plate sticker on the B-pillar.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>If despite the integral gas system, there is no sticker at the
appropriate points, the vehicle was probably converted after
sale.</li>

<li>The issuing of loose stickers to final customers is not
permissible.</li>
</ul>

<li>From the logo "ecoflex", "GPL-Tech".</li>

<li>Check Booklet in the additional Owner's Manual with the
on-board literature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Operating with explosive and flammable substances is subject to
varying national legislation which must be observed at all times.
It is essential that established technological regulations and the
legislation of the respective country are observed.</p>

<p>Observe the relevant national regulations when handling and
disposing of hazardous substances (e.g. residual gas in the
pressurised gas tanks).</p>

<p>At all workplaces in which hazardous substances are handled, the
general national handling regulations of the hazardous substances
legislation must be observed.</p>

<p>Observe the relevant environmental, health and work safety
regulations regarding explosive and flammable substances.</p>

<p>In addition, the national legal requirements for other sectors
such as accident prevention, hazardous substances legislation,
hazardous goods, traffic and building regulations etc. must be
observed.</p>

<p>Specific national legislation and guidelines for the respective
country must be observed to ensure work safety.</p>

<p>For the prevention of fire and explosive hazards in conjunction
with drilling, cutting, grinding or welding operations and material
processing, the appropriate guidelines and regulations with regard
to accident prevention issued by the specific national authorities
must be observed.</p>

<p>When working on the gas system or the gas storage equipment,
fire, naked flames, smoking and ignition sources are prohibited and
sparks must not be generated. People's attention should be drawn to
this by placing hazard-warning signs in the gas system repair
area.</p>

<p>The prohibition of smoking must be clearly and permanently
indicated by the presence of the relevant hazard-warning sign in
the workshop and at access points.</p>

<p>When the gas system is being re-started it must be checked
whether the gas system and the pressurised gas tank are still
accepted by the responsible authority (see gas container) and the
maximum permitted operating period has not been exceeded.</p>

<p>If the testing deadline or the maximum operating period has been
exceeded, the vehicle can continue to be used with the remaining
system pressure, but must not be refuelled.</p>

<p>If possible, it should be ensured that pressurised gas tanks
(natural gas) with the same expiry period are installed.</p>

<p>If a pressurised gas tank is found to be faulty or damaged so as
to constitute a hazard for operators or third parties, it must be
safely discharged without delay. If this is not possible,
alternative, suitable measures for hazard prevention must be
taken.</p>

<p>When the gas system is filled, the information in the relevant
operating instructions for the vehicle and the refuelling system
must be complied with. It must be checked whether the testing
deadlines or the maximum operating period for the pressurised gas
tank have been reached or have expired.</p>

<p>Avoid damage to gas system components such as the pressurised
gas tank.</p>

<p>In order to protect the filler valve from damage, water and
soiling, it must be closed again immediately after refuelling,
emptying the gas system or carrying out leak testing.</p>

<p>A completely or partially assembled system must not be left
unsealed.</p>

<p>The operation of CNG vehicles without gas storage systems is
prohibited and results in the cancellation of type approval.</p>

<p>In the event of injury or feeling unwell due to contact with
hazardous substances, medical attention must be sought immediately.
If possible, the doctor must be informed of the type of hazardous
substance involved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="topic">7.2 Repair Information</p>

<p>In the workshop, two separate working areas are required, in
which specific demands are made upon work safety and equipment, due
to the differing hazards which prevail:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Normal workshop area in which only maintenance and repair work
on non-gas-bearing vehicle components is performed.</li>

<li>Special workplace for gas-driven vehicles in which repair work
on gas-bearing vehicle components is performed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, before commencing an operation, the type and scope of
the repair work must be checked. Before commencing an operation, it
must also be checked whether the suggested repair work is in
accordance with the current technological standards for maintenance
work on the gas system.</p>

<p>Gas-powered vehicles such as vehicles with gasoline engines can
be dealt with during normal maintenance and repair work (with the
exception of work on the gas system). This does not apply to
vehicles with a leaking gas system.</p>

<p>Non-gas-related maintenance and repairs can also be performed by
mechanics who have not had gas training if they have been
instructed by a skilled worker (member of staff with gas training)
and the work has been accepted (inspected). However, the staff must
be aware of the relevant regulations and rules (BGR157, GUV17.1
etc.) and have been given instruction on special gas-specific
features.</p>

<p>The following generally applies: maintenance and inspection work
on the gas system may only be carried out by trained and qualified
staff who have been given Opel gas service training in workshops
set up for this purpose.</p>

<p>Repair work on gas system components such as pressure reducers
that are not described in the service instructions is not
permitted. These components must never be forced open or
modified.</p>

<p>No holes may be drilled in the underbody area, from the interior
of gas-driven vehicles. This is indicated by the stickers "Caution,
tank system: drilling / grinding prohibited" in the vehicle
interior and on the cover for the pressurised gas tanks. If there
are no stickers in the appropriate places, these must be
applied.</p>

<p>The pipe connections are manufactured to very fine tolerances.
In order to check the screw connections for correct fitting, a leak
test must be performed.</p>

<p>Because a variety of different bolts and screws are used, make
sure that you are using the correct ones. Do not mix them up.</p>

<p>Before all work on gas-bearing components and screw
connections,</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>the main shut-off valve on all pressurised gas tanks must be
closed,</li>

<li>residual pressure in the lines should be dissipated by running
the engine until it stops, if possible.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>The lines are sufficiently discharged if, after several minutes
of idling, the engine stops without the ignition being switched
off</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Keep components of the gas system away from direct heat (e.g.
incident solar radiation) and avoid temperatures in excess of 60
°C/122 °F – risk of explosion.</p>

<p>No repair operations in which temperatures in excess of 60
°C/140 °F may be encountered (e.g. during paint drying in
the combined spray / drying plant or in the paint dryer) must be
undertaken unless the vehicle's pressurised gas tanks have been
removed and the other gas system components completely discharged
and flushed with inert gas.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to flush the gas system, only inert gases may
be used which do not constitute an ignition hazard. An example of a
suitable inert gas is nitrogen.</p>

<p>Gas system components such as the pressure reducer must never be
subjected to heat; the changes to the material properties that may
occur can have a considerable effect on the operating safety of the
vehicle. The gas system components must therefore not be thawed out
using an external heat source if they freeze up.</p>

<p>Pressurised gas tanks, gas lines and all parts carrying gas must
always be removed if work is being carried out during which extreme
heat will be generated such as cutting work, grinding work,
soldering work and welding work, working with hot air or cutting
torches etc. within a distance of 1 metre or less of these
parts.</p>

<p>All other gas system components must be completely discharged
and flushed with inert gas.</p>

<p>Never install connections with missing closures, or parts that
have been impregnated with dirt, grease or moisture. Never install
pipes, hoses and individual components unless the connections are
in perfect condition.</p>

<p>Gas system components which must be loosened or removed during
repair work must be properly refastened in their original positions
using genuine Aftersales parts (cable ties, clips, wiring trough
brackets, etc.). Particular care must be taken regarding proper
routing and secure connection of gas-bearing components.</p>

<p>No other components must be fastened to gas lines, e.g.
wiring.</p>

<p>Before reusing the vehicle after repair work, the gas system
must always be subjected to a leak test, as described in the
Service Instructions.</p>

<p>Following assembly, the natural gas system must not suddenly be
subjected to natural gas under full operating pressure from the
pressurised gas tanks, e.g. due to the opening of a solenoid valve.
It would then not be possible to find a leaking connection using
the usual leak-detecting sprays as, due to the high pressure of 200
bar, the natural gas would blow away the leak-detecting medium from
the leak point without the formation of bubbles. Due to the high
pressure, leaks constitute an injury hazard.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all gas system components must be subjected to a
functional and visual check with regard to defects such as
contamination, deformation, formation of cracks, chafing, corrosion
and other damage.</p>

<p>As cut-off devices with actuators (solenoid valves) are used,
the switching function must be checked. The cut-off devices must
close automatically when the ignition is switched off
(audible).</p>

<p>Soiled parts must be cleaned and protected from ageing with
suitable anticorrosives if necessary (not oil).</p>

<p>Vehicles in which leaks in the gas system have been detected
must not be handed over to the customer – danger of
explosion.</p>

<p>Malfunctions or faults which are detected in the gas system must
be remedied immediately.</p>

<p>Filling a natural gas-driven vehicle using a system without a
gas dryer and without a filter is impermissible.</p>

<p>Switch off the engine and the auxiliary heater before filling
the pressurised gas tank system. The vehicle to be filled must be
protected against rolling by engaging the parking brake.</p>

<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Servicing and repair work on the gas system is subject to mandatory
registration, see Section 7.6.</p>

<p>Escaping gas can cause injury and freezing to parts of the body
with which it comes into contact. If necessary, suitable protective
measures must be taken, such as the wearing of protective leather
gloves.</p>

<p>Appropriate warning signs must be set up during operations on
the gas system.</p>

<p>Lift and support the vehicle at the designated jacking points
only. The jacking points on the body are vehicle-specific, are
listed in the Service Instructions in group "A" and must be
observed. It is not permissible to lift the vehicle at certain
components, e.g. pressurised gas tanks, carrier frame for
pressurised gas tanks etc., as slipping of the vehicle could cause
damage to the pressurised gas tanks or the high pressure lines.</p>

<p>Spraying or other application of oil or lubricants in the
vicinity of gas system components is prohibited – danger of
explosion.</p>

<p>Utmost cleanliness must be ensured during operations on the gas
system, especially with regard to the screw connections of
gas-bearing components. The work must be performed with the utmost
care.</p>

<p>For cleaning purposes, only use:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Clear water without cleaning additives</li>

<li>Lint-free cloths</li>
</ul>

<p>Several operations require special service tools that may only
be utilised for the purpose specified in the Service Instructions.
The use of these tools ensures safe and technically reliable repair
work, as approved by Opel/Vauxhall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="topic">7.3 Workplace</p>

<p>Since the technical safety equipment of the maintenance areas is
inadequate for working on the gas system with the release of gas
that may occur, vehicles with leaking gas systems must not be
brought into the maintenance area. These vehicles must be parked in
the open with adequate protection.</p>

<p>Do not empty gas system components in confined working
areas.</p>

<p class="bold">Action in an emergency:</p>

<p>Vehicle with defective gas system at dealership: Vehicle remains
in the open.</p>

<p>If work must be carried out on the gas system itself, before
beginning any work ensure that no hazardous, explosive atmospheres
can arise in the work area (limit build-up). Always ensure that
there is adequate aeration and venting in the workshops.</p>

<p>Adequate aeration means that the air in the work area must be
exchanged at least 3 times per hour. However, the corresponding
venting rate must be worked out by architects for each case. A
waiting period is stipulated for vehicles with damaged gas systems
which have not been closed off. This waiting period is, as a
minimum, the length of time it takes a gas system filled to maximum
to drain. During this waiting period, the vehicle should be placed
in the yard, on the area set aside and approved for the emptying of
gas tanks.</p>

<p>Suitable protective clothing must be worn when working.</p>

<p class="bold">Venting the natural gas:</p>

<p>Venting the natural gas system into the open (venting the
natural gas) and inerting the natural gas system must be carried
out on marked (e.g. cordoned off with tape) or separate open areas.
Measures must be taken to prevent electrostatic discharge. The
leakage resistance of the floor must be &lt;10 <sup class="sup">8</sup> Ohms. The area must be protected from lightning. An
emptying ban during storms would be an alternative. No-one must go
near the vehicle during and just after emptying. All emptying must
take place with a cold engine/exhaust system. Ignition sources are
prohibited within 5 metres of the blow-off source. This includes
work such as welding, cutting, disconnecting and hammering
work.</p>

<p class="bold">Draining liquid gas:</p>

<p>There are various methods of tank drainage.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td class="list--arabic--number" width="20">1.</td>
<td colspan="3">Pump out the liquid gas with subsequent controlled
burning of the gas phase.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="list--arabic--number" width="20">3.</td>
<td colspan="3">Controlled burn of the liquid gas via a torch.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<br>
 

<p>In all methods, a safety zone must be set up which may vary. The
place for erection of the safety zone must be selected so that no
gas can penetrate remote buildings, e.g. via open windows and
doors. The place must also be easily accessible and well
ventilated.</p>

<p>When draining liquid gas, ensure that the place has a safety
zone of at least 10 metres radius which may be extended if
necessary.</p>

<p>The safety zone must be fenced off in a manner which is clear to
everyone. The place must have no recesses or depressions as liquid
gas can collect here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="topic">7.4 Components</p>

<p>Because type-approved parts are assigned to the vehicle by
registration number, gas system parts that require registration
must be documented in the vehicle's Check Booklet when they are
replaced. (see section 7.6 entitled Registration).</p>

<p>Gas system components such as (e.g.) the pressure reducing
valve, are sensitive to impact. The installation of gas system
components which have fallen onto the ground is prohibited.</p>

<p>Strict observance of the use of materials and additives (such as
approved assembly pastes) is required for certain operations in the
Service Instructions.</p>

<p>Only those replacement parts approved and released for the
relevant vehicle may be used in the gas system. This is assured by
the use of Opel/Vauxhall parts.</p>

<p>Other parts may not be used, as these are not type approved and
result in the cancellation of the type approval.</p>

<p>The connections of gas system components must be sealed
immediately after removal using tight-sealing closure caps.</p>

<p>In warranty cases, returned components which have not been
sealed cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>Remove new parts from their packaging immediately prior to
installation and check visually.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="topic">7.5 Transportation and Storage</p>

<p>Pressurised gas tanks with carrier frames / gas tanks may only
be transported / returned if the following conditions are
fulfilled:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The pressurised gas tanks must be emptied, depressurised and
inerted.</li>

<li>Before disposal, the shut-off device must be closed with a
shut-off plug.</li>
</ul>

<p>The gas tanks in vehicles that have been involved in accidents
and are not going to be repaired must be removed and disposed of in
accordance with the stipulations of the country-specific laws.</p>

<p>For vehicle repairs requiring longer periods of time, removed,
non-flushed pressurised gas tanks must be stored under lock and
key. Storage with other hazardous materials (e.g. paint) is
prohibited. The storage area must identified with the corresponding
hazard symbol and must be suitable for this purpose in accordance
with national legislation.</p>

<p>The stipulations of national legislation and hazardous goods
legislation must be observed.</p>

<p>For transportation by means of road vehicles, pressurised gas
tanks must be stored in such a way that they cannot tip over, fall
off or shift their position. For the transportation of pressurised
gas tanks, only those lifting devices may be used which reliably
preclude damage to, or dropping of the pressurised gas tanks.</p>

<p class="bold">Inerting the system</p>

<p>The system which has been depressurised from its normal pressure
is then pressurised once with nitrogen at a pressure of 15 bar and
discharged; it is then pressurised with nitrogen again in a second
cycle, this time at a pressure of 10 bar, and discharged
(depressurised) again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="topic">7.6 Registration</p>

<p class="bold">All maintenance and repair work carried out on the
gas system must be entered in the vehicle's Check Booklet.</p>

<p>Continuous proof of conformance to all maintenance and repair
schedules for the vehicle is required. Statutory legislation
stipulates the storage of workshop documents for gas-powered
vehicles over a period of 10 years. It must be ensured that this
data can be retrieved if required.</p>

<p>The following registered components are installed in CNG-driven
Opel vehicles:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Pressurised gas container</li>

<li>Bottle safety valve</li>

<li>Pressure reducing valve</li>
</ul>

<p>The following registered components are installed in LPG-driven
Opel vehicles:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Liquid gas tank</li>

<li>Multi-valve</li>

<li>Pressure reducer / evaporator</li>

<li>Injection unit</li>

<li>LPG control unit</li>
</ul>

<p>Components that have to be registered bear an EU qualification
approval number / ECE number.</p>

<p>All work on the CNG gas system must be entered in the vehicle's
Check Booklet (additional instructions – monovalent plus
– LPG / GPL) / service booklet.</p>

<p>After installation of registered components, the dealer must
enter the following information in the vehicle's Check Booklet:
What was done; by whom; at what mileage reading; which registered
components were replaced.</p>

<p class="para-before-table">In principle, only gas components with
an ECE approval may be fitted.</p>
