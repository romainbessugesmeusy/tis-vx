<p class="title">General</p>

<p>In order to ensure that paint repair work is done efficiently,
the various working factors, from receiving the vehicle to
returning it to the customer, must all be taken carefully into
account. Given the differences in the way individual businesses are
set up and run, the working plan proposed here is for guidance
purposes only.</p>

<p class="topic">Reception: (customer service adviser)</p>

<p>Inspect the damage to the paintwork, bearing in mind the
capabilities and limitations of spray technology (see the points in
the chapter "Partial Paint Repair"). Inform the customer
accordingly. Determine the work needing to be done, then prepare a
cost estimate and work order. Read the AW catalogue carefully.
Carefully fill in the work order. The bodywork mechanic must
prepare the surface for painting so that the paintshop can carry
out the necessary work in accordance with the relevant working
regulations.</p>

<p class="topic">Paintwork (paintshop)</p>

<p>Read the work order carefully, examine the damaged areas, find
out the type of paint used on the vehicle from the type plate,
determine the paint format, co-ordinate the grinding tools to be
used, select filler materials, decide on the paint format according
to economic criteria and employ spray technology (see the points in
"Partial Paint Repair" chapter).</p>
