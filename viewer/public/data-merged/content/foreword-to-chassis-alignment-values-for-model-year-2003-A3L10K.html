<p class="title">Foreword to Chassis Alignment Values for Model
Year 2003</p>

<p>This "Chassis Alignment Values" brochure for Opel/Vauxhall
vehicles has been specially created for use on the chassis
alignment unit and contains all important information which is
required for the correct performance of chassis alignment.</p>

<p>This brochure contains the chassis alignment values for the
following Opel/Vauxhall vehicles for Model Year 2003:</p>

<p>Agila, Corsa-C, Combo-C, Speedster/VX 220, Astra-G, Astra-G
Coupe, Astra-G convertible, Astra OPC, Astra CNG, Zafira, Zafira
OPC, Zafira CNG, Vectra-C, Omega-B, Frontera-B, Campo/Brava, Arena,
Movano and Vivaro.</p>

<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For the
first time there are several alignment values for the Vectra-C rear
axle pertaining to different trim heights. The trim height that is
specified here is measured from the centre of the wheel hub to the
bottom edge of the wheel well at each side of the vehicle. The rear
of the vehicle must also be made horizontal by distributing weights
around the higher side of the vehicle at the rear.</p>

<p class="para-before-table">In order to visually emphasize new
values and values that have changed since the previous brochure,
the values in these data fields are shown in bold with a grey
background and the boxes around them are drawn in dotted lines. For
information with differing tolerance values the visual emphasis can
only be provided for the main information, but the tolerance may be
affected by the change anyway, as shown in the following
examples:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="border-none">

</td>

to attach the wheel mirror or measuring unit for chassis
alignment.</p>
