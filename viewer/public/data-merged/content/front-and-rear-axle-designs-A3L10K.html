<p class="title">Front and rear axle designs</p>

<p>The type of chassis design or suspension in a car or off-road
vehicle is heavily dependent upon the type of drive. There is a
rough differentiation between independent wheel suspension and
rigid axles.</p>

<p>For Opel/Vauxhall vehicles, front-mounted engines are normally
used. One exception at present is the Speedster/VX220. Therefore
only individual suspension is used as the front axle construction.
This is characterised by little space requirement, low weight and
independence of the individual wheels.</p>

<p>In Opel/Vauxhall vehicles, three types of front independent
suspensions are installed - the spring strut type using the
McPherson principle with or without a front-axle body and the
double-wishbone axle.</p>

<p>The rear axle constructions of the Opel/Vauxhall vehicles are
mainly rigid axle, torsion beam axle and multi-link suspension
(Vectra-C/Signum), where we distinguish between driven and
non-driven rear axles. Because of the said advantages of the
individual suspension however this is used in current Opel/Vauxhall
vehicles.</p>
