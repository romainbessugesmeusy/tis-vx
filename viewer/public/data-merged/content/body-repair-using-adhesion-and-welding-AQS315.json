If any\nparts of the partial body shell are damaged severely enough to\nwarrant replacement then the partial body shell should be replaced.\nAdhesives are used only in limited areas, glass, grilles etc. as\nwell as bonding fibreglass components to the aluminium partial body\nshell. Normal workshop practice is appropriate in this application.\nBody repairs using normal fibreglass techniques is permissible in\nmost areas.</p>\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  \r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td ></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
