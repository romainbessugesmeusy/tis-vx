<p class="title">Safety Regulations for the Bodywork</p>

<p class="topic">10.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Most operations are shown in the form of illustrations.
Explanatory text has been added only at points where instructions
are important to proper and appropriate repair.</li>

<li>The illustrations with the inserted operational instructions
show the order of the operations. No special reference is made to
repeated standard operations such as cutting operations or grinding
connecting surfaces down to the bare metal, since the Aftersales
companies are aware of these operations.</li>

<li>The repair methods specified in module A must be complied with
in areas in which both cutting and connecting operations affect the
strength and roadworthiness of the body.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">10.2 Repair Information – Preparation</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>For the prevention of fire and explosive hazards in conjunction
with drilling, cutting, grinding or welding operations and material
processing, the appropriate guidelines and regulations with regard
to accident prevention issued by the specific national authorities
must be observed. This is especially applicable to natural
gas-driven vehicles.</li>

<li>No holes may be drilled in the underbody area from the interior
of on gas-driven vehicles. This is indicated by the stickers
"Caution, tank system: drilling / grinding prohibited" in the
vehicle interior and on the cover for the pressurised gas tanks.
The presence / absence of such stickers does not replace the need
to establish the location of the tank system before starting
drilling and grinding work. If there are no stickers in the
appropriate places, these must be applied.</li>

<li>Pressurised gas tanks with carrier frames, gas lines as well as
all natural gas-bearing components must always be removed when
performing operations involving the generation of significant
amounts of heat, e.g. cutting, grinding, soldering or welding,
working with hot-air blowers or cutting torches etc., at a distance
of &lt;= 1 metre from these components.</li>

<li>All other natural gas system components must be completely
discharged and flushed with inert gas.</li>

<li>During any cutting, grinding, soldering or welding operations,
it must be ensured that a suitable device for extracting vapours
and dust particles is available. This is especially applicable to
galvanised body components. Additional protection is required for
flying sparks.</li>

<li>Always wear protective goggles and a dust mask during cutting,
grinding or welding operations and material machining.</li>

<li>Follow storage instructions on container packages when storing
solvent-containing substances – fire hazard.</li>

<li>Avoid naked flames.</li>

<li>Fire extinguishers must be available in adequate numbers and
routinely serviced.</li>

<li>Observe environmental and health protection regulations.</li>

<li>For the sake of fire prevention, never apply protective
materials to or in the immediate vicinity of components near the
engine and exhaust system (e.g. catalytic converter, oxygen
sensor).</li>

<li>The fuel tank and fuel pipes must always be removed if welding
operations are performed near these components – danger of
explosion.</li>

<li>Following accidents indicating considerable stress on the
chassis, the following components in particular should be checked,
independently of checking chassis alignment, which should be
carried out in all cases:</li>

<li>Ensure proper operation of steering and steering linkage
through the entire steering angle. Visual check for deformation and
cracks.</li>

<li>In addition, check the chassis and all related components for
deformation and cracks, including spring struts, steering knuckles,
control arms, axle bodies, stabilisers and associated fastening
parts.</li>

<li>Visually check wheel rims and tyres for damage, for cuts in
tread and side walls, and for true running and balance.</li>

<li>All components that have been loosened or removed during repair
work must be re-fastened at their original installation locations.
Replace damaged components (e.g. micro-encapsulated bolts) with new
parts.</li>

<li>Always attach the earth terminal of the welding equipment to
the immediate vicinity of the welding point. Ensure perfect ground
connections.</li>

<li>Before operations involving a risk of electrical short circuit,
the ground cable must be disconnected from the battery. This also
applies for welding and soldering work on the vehicle.</li>

<li>Control units may be damaged at temperatures above 80
°C/176 °F.</li>

<li>During soldering, welding and straightening work in the
immediate vicinity of sensitive components (e.g. electrical/
electronic/ pyrotechnical components, control units, wiring
harnesses and air conditioning components) the components must be
removed. If minor assembly or bodywork operations are being
performed (no use of slide hammer, for example) it is sufficient to
switch the ignition OFF. When repair work is being carried out in
the vicinity of airbag system sensors, the sensors must be checked
for damage and replaced if necessary. Remove ignition key and keep
in a safe place during start-up.</li>

<li>Example for the removal of airbag components / sensors:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Area of airbag sensors on upper front of vehicle, front doors
or door pillars / B-pillars on vehicles with side airbag sensors in
front doors.</li>

<li>In vicinity of roof and upper rear quarter panel including A,
B, C and D-pillars for vehicles with curtain airbag.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p class="topic">10.3 Repair Information – General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Never grind or smooth butt welds / solder joints at frame
parts.</li>

<li>For proper repair of accident-damaged vehicles, the body
measurement / alignment systems recommended by Opel / Vauxhall must
be used.</li>

<li>Since all welded /soldered parts (primary and secondary frames)
– especially in the area of the floor frame group – are
of paramount importance to the driving, operating and, above all,
accident safety (deformation characteristics) of the vehicle, the
specified cutting points, weld seam formations and jointing
processes must be performed according to the specifications in the
Service Instructions.</li>

<li>Body sheet metal parts and body members (underbody) are made of
cold-workable, deep-drawn sheet steel in standard production.
Damaged parts must be cold when restoring them to their original
shape.</li>

<li>B-pillar reinforcements of high tempered PHS steel must not be
ground!</li>

<li>If any deformities are present in the primary and secondary
bearer areas, the repair must always be carried out using body
measuring and aligning systems.</li>

<li>Only when these preconditions are fulfilled can a correct
diagnosis be made for establishing the proper repair
procedure.</li>

<li>The separating points, welding/solder seam forms and jointing
methods specified must be implemented with particular care in order
to restore the original strength conditions. For inert gas welding
(MAG), active inert gases must be used such as carbon dioxide and
mixed gases with high argon proportion and mixtures of oxygen and
carbon dioxide. For soldering, the original CiSi3 solder wire must
be used as the solder parameters of the equipment are set to
this.</li>

<li>The required electrode contact pressure during resistance spot
welding using handheld spot welding tongs is inadequate when using
electrode holders that are longer than 40 cm.</li>

<li>The welders, types and parameters recommended by Opel/Vauxhall
must be used.</li>

<li>The weld point adhesive recommended by Opel/Vauxhall must be
used.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">10.4 Repair Information – Corrosion
Protection</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>In order to ensure that long-term protection after repairs or
part replacement is also guaranteed in Aftersales, the damaged area
must be treated with cavity preservation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Important guidelines for restoration of the original corrosion
protection:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Clean the welding points (spot-welded galvanised body panels
have only minimal erosion around the welding spot).</li>

<li>Always apply spot-weld paint to both sides of the welding
flange.</li>

<li>Prime bare metal points immediately after repair work.</li>

<li>Use sealing compound to protect sheet metal overlaps, abutting
joints, flanges and welding seams.</li>

<li>Seal with protective wax following repair work. Water drains in
the A, B, C, D-pillars, in the rear quarter panelling and in the
area of the floor group must remain intact and free of dirt and
sealing compound.</li>

<li>Always apply sprayable seam seal to primed and cured
surfaces.</li>

<li>The welding procedures appearing in the various operations are
identified by welding symbols.</li>

<li>There is no difference between the welding of body untreated
deep drawn sheet metal and of alloy-galvanised sheet metal.</li>

<li>Spot welding is the preferred procedure for alloy-galvanised
sheet metal.</li>

<li>Remove all paint layers from welding and soldering points.</li>

<li>Use corrosion protection materials from "Aftersales".</li>

<li>Grind bare adhesive surfaces of new part with KTL primer in
vicinity of spot-welds only (also applies to galvanised sheet metal
parts).</li>

<li>Perforating punches (plug welding) are not to be used for
materials thicker than 1 mm. For new-part material thicker than 1
mm, use a drill preparatory to plug welding.</li>

<li>For material thicknesses up to 3 mm, optionally inert gas
soldering or spot-welders may be used for joining - see
corresponding Service Instruction.</li>

<li>Always apply spot weld paint between the connection flanges.
Perform a test weld prior to welding in new parts.</li>

<li>For any cutting, grinding, soldering or welding operations,
apply heat barrier paste in the area of adhesive and sealant
materials to protect the adhesive against burning.</li>

<li>Do not apply spot weld paint to bare-ground adhesive
flanges.</li>

<li>Remove PVC underseal / sealant materials in the area of the
wheel housing using hot air or rotating wire brush.</li>

<li>Use plastic or wire brush to remove paint and primer.</li>

<li>Do not use thermal cutting processes (cutting torch/plasma
burner) for cutting operations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">10.5 Repair Information – Galvanised Sheet
Metal Parts</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>To reduce zinc-layer damage in cutting areas to a minimum,
preference should be given to mechanical cutting processes (e.g.
spot weld drill, body saw).</li>

<li>Preparation and welding: Do not use spot weld paint for
cemented and welded flanges (incompatibility/loss of
adhesion).</li>

<li>Grind new parts at welding points only (high-grade galvanised
new parts with KTL primer are thus preserved).</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">10.6 Repair Information – Cemented Glass
Panes</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Refer to corresponding tables in the Service Instructions for
lay-over times for freshly cemented glass panes.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="none" class="none">
<li>For reasons of safety and quality, it is necessary to maintain
vehicle lay-over times after cementing glass panes in Service - see
corresponding Service Instruction.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Cement in glass pane at room temperature (18 °C/64 °F
to 28 °C/82 °F) and under dust-free conditions.</li>
</ul>
