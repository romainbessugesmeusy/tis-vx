<p class="title">General Information</p>

<p class="bold">OPEL/VAUXHALL SERVICE PLAN</p>

<p>This publication contains the Service information for:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Opel Speedster/Vauxhall VX220 vehicles as of Model Year
2001.</li>
</ul>

<p>This edition, issued on CD-ROM and as a printed brochure
replaces all previous editions.</p>

<p>The Opel/Vauxhall Service Plan is applicable world-wide.
Features specific to individual countries, such as deviating legal
requirements or checks, cannot be covered in detail and are not
included in this publication. Where appropriate, separate
information should be observed. Always adhere to safe working
practices and observe local regulations regarding health
protection, accident prevention and environmental protection.</p>

<p class="bold">Opel Speedster/Vauxhall VX220 Service Schedule:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Main service: every 15 000 km/10 000 miles or annually
whichever occurs first.</li>
</ul>

<p>For scheduled service operations which are performed on an
irregular basis such as timing belt replacement are performed where
possible in conjunction with the relevant Service Schedule.</p>

<p>Each Service must be performed using the relevant Service
Schedule/Service Check List. The fully completed check list must
always be handed to the customer together with the invoice. The
check list used must correspond with the Schedule in the Service
Booklet.</p>

<p class="bold">The following new features are especially
noteworthy:</p>

<p>The scope of the work operations have been re-evaluated and the
labour times revised.</p>

<p>The Z 20 LET Turbo engine is now included in the Speedster/VX220
service plan for the first time.</p>

<p>A new operation: “Timing belt and tension roller:
replace”, has been included for the new Z 20 LET Turbo
engine.</p>

<p class="bold">Time Allowances</p>

<p>Contains the time allowance for the Service Schedule. In
individual cases, the specified time allowance may be either higher
or lower than the actual value. These are the recommended values.
The time allowance for vehicle set-up "Vehicle from Parking Place
to Workplace and Back" =&nbsp;.2&nbsp;hrs - is included in the
specified values and not given separately. The time allowances do
not include a specification for test drives. The time expenditure
for test drives - as for test drives after repair operations - is
covered by the regular workshop overhead rate.</p>

<p>The time allowances are listed separately for the Service
Schedule and additional items.</p>

<p>Pneumatic wrenches are used for determining time allowances for
detaching wheel nuts/bolts.</p>

<p>Time allowances for the service now include the use of power
tools to remove and install the engine undertrays.</p>

<p>Also, within the Additional Operation schedule, there are
operations which are performed irregularly, e.g. replace timing
belt. The time allowances for the additional operations are not
included in the Service and must be invoiced separately. We
recommend that, where possible, these operations be performed
during the Service as the time allowances are then considerably
lower than when the operations are performed separately. This
applies especially to the exhaust emissions test, which is no
longer included in the regular inspection.</p>

<p class="bold">Severe Operating Conditions</p>

<p>Severe operating conditions include frequent cold starts,
frequent driving in stop and go traffic, use as a hire car, etc.,
and frequent short-distance driving.</p>

<p>Extreme, external environmental influences includes, areas with
a high degree of air pollution (drift sand), a high pollutant
burden, large temperature variations, high humidity, etc.</p>

<p>If the service reveals that the vehicle is operated under severe
operating conditions or is subjected to extreme external
environmental influences, the customer's attention must be drawn to
the necessity for more frequent servicing.</p>

<p>Frequent city and short-distance driving more than triples the
load on the engine oil and engine wear compared with intercity and
motorway driving. As a consequence, the performance of the engine
oil deteriorates and requires more frequent changing when used for
short-distance driving.</p>

<p>An additional engine oil and filter change is recommended for
"normal mileage" with frequent cold starts or mainly city or
short-distance driving. This must be confirmed by stamping the
specific fields in the Service Booklet.</p>

<p class="bold">Exhaust emissions test (AU)</p>

<p>An exhaust emission test is not included in the Service Plan,
however, it can be performed during a Service. The data required
for the exhaust emission test is listed in the Exhaust Emission
Test brochure.</p>

<p>For additional operations (trouble code read-out, circuit test,
idle speeds etc.), refer to the corresponding Checking
Procedures.</p>
