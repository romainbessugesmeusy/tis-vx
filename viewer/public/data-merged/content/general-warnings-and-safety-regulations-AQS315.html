<p class="topic">1.2 Definitions</p>

<p>Carefully read and observe safety regulations and important
instructions before beginning diagnostic and repair work.</p>

<p>Safety regulations and important information in Checking
Procedures, Service Instructions, Service Plan, Pre-delivery
Inspection and Technical Information Bulletins are subdivided into
"Caution:" and "Note:" As of Model Year 2002, the previous
expression "Caution:" will be replaced by "Warning:" and
"Important:" in order to better differentiate between the danger of
personal injury and the danger of damage to components or to
vehicles.</p>

<p>Meaning of individual expressions...</p>

<p><span class="gt-warning">Warning:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
Describes the implementation or omission of situations or measures,
in order to prevent personal injury.</p>

<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
Describes the implementation or omission of situations or measures,
in order to prevent damage to components or to vehicles.</p>

<p class="topic">Caution:</p>

<p>Describes the implementation or omission of situations or
measures requiring extreme care so as to prevent personal injury as
well as damage to components or to vehicles.</p>

<p><span class="gt-notice">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><br>
Contains additional tips and tricks and a detailed explanation of
how to perform the associated operation.</p>

<p class="topic">1.3 Legislation</p>

<p>These "Safety Regulations and Important Instructions" are not
exhaustive, as Opel/Vauxhall cannot reasonably anticipate every
conceivable service and repair method and the consequences
thereof.</p>

<p>It is therefore vital for anyone carrying out repair work on a
vehicle to ensure that the repair method that has been selected
will not affect their own safety or the vehicle.</p>

<p>Since different laws apply in the different countries, it is not
possible to go into details in the service literature. Anyone
involved in maintenance and repair work must be aware of the
guidelines and laws that apply to their job and follow them
accordingly.</p>

<p>It is expressly pointed out that all work on the systems
described in the following must be carried out in accordance with
the applicable guidelines and regulations issued by the local
authorities and the health and safety, accident prevention and
environmental protection authorities.</p>

<p>Contact with certain operating materials may be damaging to
health. Specific national legislation pertaining to hazardous
substances governs the proper handling of materials. The
identification code is printed on the material container label.
Restrictions are subject to national legislation.</p>

<p>Danger classes applicable in individual countries govern the
proper storage of combustible liquids; relevant danger classes are
printed on the container label. Restrictions are subject to
national legislation.</p>

<p>Observe the relevant national regulations when handling and
disposing of hazardous substances (e.g. non-deployed airbag
modules) and recyclable materials (e.g. plastic, metal, used oil).
Opel safety data sheets must be observed.</p>

<p class="topic">Safety data sheets</p>

<p>The safety data sheets can be read on the Internet:
www.ifz-berlin.de</p>

<p>The product groups are subdivided there as follows:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Airbags/belt tensioners</li>

<li>Other products</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">1.4 Chemical Products</p>

<p class="topic">Fuels</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Fuel/air mixtures are explosive. Keep away from flames and
naked lights when working on the fuel system and avoid ignition
sources and sparks. The relevant environmental and health
regulations applicable to explosive, extremely flammable substances
must be observed.</li>

<li>The fuel system must be checked for leaks before and after
repair work. Build-up of explosive petrol concentrations is
possible at leaking fuel-bearing components. Appropriate warning
signs must be set up during operations on the fuel tank.</li>

<li>Petrol and diesel fuels are toxic. Swallowing of fuel or
inhalation of the fumes can be fatal. Contact with the skin must be
avoided.</li>

<li>Do not drain fuel tanks above a workshop pit. Fuel vapours
settle at the bottom of the pit and remain there. Engine adjustment
operations can also lead to the release of fuel vapours and exhaust
gases that pose health risks. Work on lifting ramps in sufficiently
ventilated areas only.</li>

<li>The fuel tank must only be emptied using a fuel refilling unit
using the gas displacement method, see also catalogue
"Opel/Vauxhall Workshop Equipment". Keep drained fuel in suitable
containers.</li>

<li>Escaping fuel must be removed immediately, e.g. using a binding
agent.</li>

<li>The utmost cleanliness is important when working on the open
fuel system.</li>

<li>Among other things, engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons and nitrous oxide. Ensure that there is an effective
extraction system. Exhaust from diesel engines can lead to skin and
respiratory organ diseases. Carbon monoxide is a powerful blood
poison.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">Oils and Lubricants</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Explosive mixtures can result from heating or spraying oils and
lubricants &ndash; danger of explosion.</li>

<p class="topic">1.7 Water Damage</p>

<p>Control units in passenger compartment and luggage compartment
have only limited resistance to water. Although no damage is caused
by drops of water, correct function of the affected control units
is no longer guaranteed if considerable amounts of water penetrate
the vehicle. In particular, if safety-relevant control units and
electric components in the passenger compartment (e.g. ABS, Airbag,
EPS, engine control unit, servotronic, seat memory) are damaged, it
is essential that they are replaced with new components.</p>

<p class="topic">1.8 Diagnosis</p>

<p>If the "Airbag system" indicator light is active, the fault in
the airbag system must first be remedied before starting diagnosis
and repair on other systems.</p>

<p>A pyrotechnic unit that has been diagnosed as defective must not
be deployed locally but must be returned. Follow the retention
systems safety instructions in the Transport and Storage chapter
and use the return address!</p>

<p>Do not suspend the diagnosis tester from the steering wheel by
the bracket.</p>

<p>Follow the special instructions in the "Safety Regulations -
Retention Systems" chapter. Vehicles with a fault code set in the
airbag system ("Airbag System" indicator light on) must not be
handed over to customers - danger to occupants!</p>
