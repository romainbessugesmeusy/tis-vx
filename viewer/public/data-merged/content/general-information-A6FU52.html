  <b>Vehicle Diagnostic Concept:</b>
</p>
<p>The main purpose of a vehicle diagnostic concept is locating and eliminating faults in the shortest time possible. Therefore, the following diagnostic strategy has been developed as a guideline that leads technicians straight to the source fault:<br><br>Starting point is the vehicle that contains a certain number of electronic systems, e.g. engine management system, airbag, and ABS system.<br>Each of these electronic systems consists of so - called "functional groups" that are functionally related to each other. A Coolant Temperature Sensor Circuit for example represents such a functional group.<br>Each of the functional groups consists of several components, such as switches, sensors, wires etc. A Coolant Temperature Sensor Circuit for example is made up of a sensor, a wiring harness, a control unit, and the software of the control unit.<br>Based on this structure, the first diagnostic step should be the identification and localisation of the defective electronic system, next comes the diagnosis of the corresponding defective functional group, and finally, locate and repair of the defective component within that group.<br><br>The Diagnostic System Check (described in table A, Diagnostic System Check) of this checking procedure follows that diagnostic path. Diagnosis of an electronic system according to the above described concept always starts with this Main Check.
</p>
<p>The instructions described in the Diagnostic System Check section must be followed closely. Every time a test or test step is passed without fault, the Diagnostic System Check continues with the next step. Some of the tests include references to related functional groups (tables B-x). When there is a fault, the corresponding functional group tests are performed in order to detect the defective functional group. When that group has been identified, the troubleshooting tables (C-x) are used to locate the faulty component. After repair of the fault, the affected functional group (tables B-x) must be rechecked to continue after this test at the appropriate position of the Diagnostic System Check (table A).<br>When all test steps of the Diagnostic System Check have been completed successfully, the system is fully operational.
