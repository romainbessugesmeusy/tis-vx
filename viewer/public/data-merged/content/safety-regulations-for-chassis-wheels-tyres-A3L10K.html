<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Chassis, Wheels, Tyres</p>

<p class="topic">4.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Note running direction when installing running
direction-dependent tyres.</li>

<li>If disc wheels for converting to winter tyres have not been
provided in the factory, ensure that long tyre valves are pulled in
when using hub caps that cover the entire area.</li>

<li>Only use vehicle-approved hub caps (brake system cooling).</li>
</ul>

<p>Following an accident, the following components should be
visually checked for bending and cracks, independently of the
chassis alignment check, which should always be performed:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Chassis and all related components, such as spring strut,
steering knuckle, control arm, axle body, stabilisers and
associated fastening parts.</li>

<li>Wheel rims and tyres. In addition, visually check for cuts,
tread depth and run-out.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">4.2 Repair Information – Chassis</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>For all operations where there is the risk of an electrical
short circuit, disconnect the ground cable from the battery.</li>

<li>The thread of screw connections that have been used with
sealing compound must be cleaned or recut. Use screws with sealing
compound.</li>

<li>Only use suitable special service tools to perform assembly
work on pre-tensioned springs – danger of injury.</li>

<li>Always replace damping bushings, damping rings, shock
absorbers, and springs in pairs.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">4.3 Repair Information – Wheels and
Tyres</p>

<p class="bold">Wheel bolts (all vehicles with wheel bolts except
Agila-B)</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Before fitting "dry" wheel bolts, coat their taper surfaces
with roller bearing grease unless specified otherwise below.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Wheel bolts (Agila-B)</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>NEVER grease or lubricate the wheel bolts. The wheel bolts must
be clean and dry.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Wheel nuts and bolts (all vehicles with wheel nuts
and bolts except Agila-A)</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>NEVER grease or lubricate the wheel nuts, bolts and mounting
surfaces. Wheel nuts, bolts and mounting surfaces must be clean and
dry.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Wheel nuts and bolts (Agila-A)</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Before installing "dry" wheel nuts, apply a thin coat of
anti-friction bearing grease to the conical surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Tyres</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>To prevent damage to the tyres during fitting and removal, in
particular for RunFlat tyres and super-low profile tyres, always
use the corresponding equipment, see also "TIS2Web/News/Workshop
Equipment/Tyre fitting equipment, Balancing machines".</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Wheels</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>To prevent the centring seat seizing on the wheel, coat the
inner centring seat on the rim with roller bearing grease.</li>
</ul>
