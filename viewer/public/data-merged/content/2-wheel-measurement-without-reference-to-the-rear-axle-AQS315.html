<p class="title">2-wheel measurement without reference to the rear
axle</p>

<p>In this measurement process, it is only possible to align the
wheels on one axle at a time. The suspension geometry of the front
and rear axles must be determined separately.</p>

<p>In conjunction with rotary bases, the main values of the
suspension geometry can be determined. Reference measurement
between the front and rear axles is not however possible with this
process taking into account the geometric driving axis and the axis
of symmetry.</p>

<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Alignment machines with 2-wheel alignment are not approved for
Opel/Vauxhall vehicles.</p>

<p>This measurement process includes e.g. axle alignment
bridges.</p>
