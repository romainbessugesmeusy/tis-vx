<p class="MsoNormal"><b>LPG Draining, Venting and Purging</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Certain repairs will require the draining and purging of the
LPG system.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hazards:</b></p>

<h6 style="page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-family:&quot;Tms Rmn&quot;">Bleeding
the system requires isolation of the LPG tank and purging the LPG by means of
running the engine until the system switches to the Petrol mode, disconnection
of any of the system components will result in a small amount of LPG being
released into the atmosphere.</span></h6>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Draining of the system should be done by extraction using a
LPG recovery and transfer pumping equipment only. This type of apparatus is
commercially available but if you require further information please consult
your Local Authority for guidance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Safety measures:</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Bleeding operations should be only done in a designated
ventilated area.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The manufacturers safe working instructions for the pumping
equipment must be followed at all times.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ensure the LPG is placed into suitable storage containers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When purging the system or tank, ensure after draining the
system is drawn down to a negative pressure prior to the dried compressed air
being introduced. Failure to draw down the system will result in the release of
residual LPG vapours.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ensure only qualified technicians work on this equipment,
they will have to be trained on correct isolation, draining and removal
procedures for fuel tanks and leak detection</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ensure that vehicle repairs are carried out in areas with</b>
<b>good ventilation</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When tasks have to be undertaken in a confined space, a
second safety person should be present. They must observe the technician
working within the confined space from outside that area.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ensure that the LPG tanks do not become heated by
prohibiting any welding or heat related repair processes near it, Under no
circumstances should a vehicle be placed in a spray / baking&nbsp; booth and baked
as part of a paint process. When these types of repair are necessary the LPG
system requires purging and draining before removing the tank from the vehicle.
Removed tanks should not be left exposed to direct sunlight for long periods.
This is the same affect as baking in a paint booth.</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Storage of LPG tanks removed from the vehicle must conform
to the highly flammable liquids and liquefied petroleum gases regulations 1972
and the pressure systems and transportable gas containers regulations 1996.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The local authority should be consulted regarding the siting
of the storage area. Alternatively the LPG gas association code of practice 7,
storage of full and empty LPG cylinders and cartridges, provides a concise set
of guidelines recommended by the HSE for use.</p>
