There is a\nrough differentiation between independent wheel suspension and\nrigid axles.</p>\n\n<p>For Opel/Vauxhall vehicles, front-mounted engines are normally\nused. One exception at present is the Speedster/VX220. Therefore\nonly individual suspension is used as the front axle construction.\nThis is characterised by little space requirement, low weight and\nindependence of the individual wheels.</p>\n\n<p>In Opel/Vauxhall vehicles, three types of front independent\nsuspensions are installed - the spring strut type using the\nMcPherson principle with or without a front-axle body and the\ndouble-wishbone axle.</p>\n\n<p>The rear axle constructions of the Opel/Vauxhall vehicles are\nmainly rigid axle, torsion beam axle and multi-link suspension\n(Vectra-C/Signum), where we distinguish between driven and\nnon-driven rear axles. Because of the said advantages of the\nindividual suspension however this is used in current Opel/Vauxhall\nvehicles.</p>\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  \r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td ></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
