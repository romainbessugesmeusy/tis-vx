Anyone\ninvolved in maintenance and repair work must be aware of the\nguidelines and laws that apply to their job and follow them\naccordingly.</p>\n\n<p>It is expressly pointed out that all work on the systems\ndescribed in the following must be carried out in accordance with\nthe applicable guidelines and regulations issued by the local\nauthorities and the health and safety, accident prevention and\nenvironmental protection authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Contact with certain operating materials may be damaging to\nhealth. Specific national legislation pertaining to hazardous\nsubstances governs the proper handling of materials. The\nidentification code is printed on the material container label.\nRestrictions are subject to national legislation.</p>\n\n<p>Danger classes applicable in individual countries govern the\nproper storage of combustible liquids; relevant danger classes are\nprinted on the container label. Restrictions are subject to\nnational legislation.</p>\n\n<p>Observe the relevant national regulations when handling and\ndisposing of hazardous substances (e.g. non-deployed airbag\nmodules) and recyclable materials (e.g. plastic, metal, used oil).\nOpel safety data sheets must be observed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Safety data sheets</p>\n\n<p>The safety data sheets can be read on the Internet:\nwww.ifz-berlin.de</p>\n\n<p>The product groups are subdivided there as follows:</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Airbags/belt tensioners</li>\n\n<li>Batteries</li>\n\n<li>Brake fluids</li>\n\n<li>Paints/raw materials</li>\n\n<li>Greases</li>\n\n<li>Radiator anti-freeze</li>\n\n<li>Spray paint/touch-up pens</li>\n\n<li>Engine oils</li>\n\n<li>Engineering oils</li>\n\n<li>Other products</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">1.4 Chemical Products</p>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Fuels</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Fuel/air mixtures are explosive.

The relevant environmental and health\nregulations applicable to explosive, extremely flammable substances\nmust be observed.</li>\n\n<li>The fuel system must be checked for leaks before and after\nrepair work. Build-up of explosive petrol concentrations is\npossible at leaking fuel-bearing components. Appropriate warning\nsigns must be set up during operations on the fuel tank.</li>\n\n<li>Petrol and diesel fuels are toxic. Swallowing of fuel or\ninhalation of the fumes can be fatal. Contact with the skin must be\navoided.</li>\n\n<li>Do not drain fuel tanks above a workshop pit. Fuel vapours\nsettle at the bottom of the pit and remain there. Engine adjustment\noperations can also lead to the release of fuel vapours and exhaust\ngases that pose health risks. Work on lifting ramps in sufficiently\nventilated areas only.</li>\n\n<li>The fuel tank must only be emptied using a fuel refilling unit\nusing the gas displacement method, see also catalogue\n\"Opel/Vauxhall Workshop Equipment\". Keep drained fuel in suitable\ncontainers.</li>\n\n<li>Escaping fuel must be removed immediately, e.g. using a binding\nagent.</li>\n\n<li>The utmost cleanliness is important when working on the open\nfuel system.</li>\n\n<li>Among other things, engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide,\nhydrocarbons and nitrous oxide. Ensure that there is an effective\nextraction system. Exhaust from diesel engines can lead to skin and\nrespiratory organ diseases. Carbon monoxide is a powerful blood\npoison.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Oils and Lubricants</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Explosive mixtures can result from heating or spraying oils and\nlubricants &ndash; danger of explosion.</li>\n\n<li>Breathing or generating oil mist or vapours must be avoided.\nOils and lubricants are toxic when ingested.</li>\n\n<li>Oils and lubricants are flammable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Handling Chemical Products</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Do not process any materials whose expiry dates have elapsed.\nIt is essential that the relevant instructions on container\npackaging are observed.</li>\n\n<li>Avoid using adhesives that are no longer suitable for use\n&ndash; they pose a threat to vehicle passengers and to the\nenvironment &ndash; danger of injury.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Solvent-containing Substances</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>The following materials and compounds contain solvents:</li>\n\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>Paints</li>\n\n<li>Primers, varnishes</li>\n\n<li>Glass primers</li>\n\n<li>Fillers</li>\n\n<li>Putties</li>\n\n<li>Hardeners</li>\n\n<li>Thinners</li>\n\n<li>Activators</li>\n\n<li>Additives</li>\n\n<li>Contents of spray cans</li>\n\n<li>Body seals</li>\n\n<li>Cavity sealants</li>\n\n<li>Underseals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>Follow storage instructions on container packages when storing\nsolvent-containing substances &ndash; fire hazard.</li>\n\n<li>Process solvent-containing substances either in painting booths\nor in areas with suitable extraction.</li>\n\n<li>If not observed, risk of injury, above all to respiratory\nsystem or explosion!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">1.5 Protective Clothing</p>\n\n<p>Employers and superiors are responsible for ensuring that\nworking environments are safe.
