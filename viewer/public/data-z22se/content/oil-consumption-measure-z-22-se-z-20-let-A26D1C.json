A clear distinction\nshould be made between oil consumption and oil loss caused by leaks\nat the oil pan, cylinder head etc.</p>\n\n<p class=\"para-before-list\">The purpose of the engine oil is\nto:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"list--arabic--number\" width=\"20\">1.</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">separate surfaces that slide on one another with an\noil film, i.e. prevent dry friction.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td class=\"list--arabic--number\" width=\"20\">2.</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">dissipate the heat caused by friction;</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td class=\"list--arabic--number\" width=\"20\">3.</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Carry away combustion residues.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n \n\n<p>These tasks require a certain amount of oil consumption, and\naccordingly the expectation that progress made in the development\nof combustion engines will one day lead to an engine which does not\nconsume any oil at all is unfounded. The oil consumption depends on\nthe operating conditions, the driving style and the production\ntolerances. Under normal conditions the oil consumption is so low\nthat no or barely any oil needs to be added between the specified\noil changes. However, it is essential that oil is added if the oil\nlevel drops below the \"MIN\" mark on the dipstick. It is also\nextremely important to ensure that the oil level does not exceed\nthe \"MAX\" mark, as this would cause excessive oil consumption.</p>\n\n<p>As the oil consumption is due to technical factors, the correct\ninterpretation of apparent non&ndash;consumption of oil by an\nengine is that the oil is being diluted as a result of specific\noperating conditions. Frequent cold starts, driving with a cold\nengine etc. cause the oil flowing back to the oil pan to carry\nnon&ndash;volatile fuel components and condensation products. These\ndilute the oil and lead to the incorrect assumption that the engine\nis not consuming any oil at all.</p>\n\n<p>Oil which has become diluted in this way loses its lubricating\nproperties and can eventually lead to engine damage if the\nspecified oil change intervals are not adhered to. The main causes\nfor oil dilution are: driving the vehicle mostly in urban traffic\nand frequent driving at low engine speeds with a cold engine.</p>\n\n<p>As the oil consumption does not stabilise until after a few\nthousand kilometres, oil consumption measurements do not yield\nrealistic results until the vehicle has covered approx. 7500 km.\nBefore measuring the oil consumption it is important to check that\nthe engine is not losing oil as a result of leaks.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"gt-notice\">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The oil\ndipstick only performs a checking function and cannot be used for\nthe measurement. The engine must always be switched off for at\nleast 2 minutes before checking the oil level. If after an oil\nchange the maximum engine oil filling does not correspond to the\nmaximum level on the oil dipstick, this can be explained with the\nproduction tolerances.</p>\n\n<p>All information regarding the permissible engine oil consumption\nand filling quantities is included in the Owner's Guide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Measuring method</p>\n\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"border-none\">\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"NaN%\" align=\"left\">\n<col width=\"NaN%\" align=\"left\"></colgroup>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>The test is performed with the vehicle level and the engine at\noperating temperature (minimum engine oil temperature <span class=\n\"tech-spec\">80 &deg;C/176 &deg;F</span> ).</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Switch off the engine and immediately drain the oil &ndash;\ndrain time approx. 30 minutes (empirical value).</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>3</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>The amount of drained oil is measured in a measuring cylinder.\n<a class=\"ftnref\" href=\"#1\" title=\n\"Measuring cylinder (transparent) with a volume of 1 to 2 litres.\">1)</a>\nand, using new oil, the engine is topped up to maximum fill\ncapacity less the amount for the oil filter which has not been\nchanged.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n \n\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"border-none\">\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"NaN%\" align=\"left\">\n<col width=\"NaN%\" align=\"left\"></colgroup>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>4</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>The customer must then drive the vehicle for at least 1000 km\nwithout adding engine oil (the driver should stick to his/her\nnormal routes and driving style).</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>5</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Afterwards the process described above (points 1 and 2) is\nrepeated with exactly the same engine oil drain time.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>6</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>The quantity of oil now missing from the measuring cylinder\ncorresponds to the engine oil consumption for the mileage covered\nin the mean time.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>7</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"border-none\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>The oil consumption is calculated as follows: Added oil quantity\n(l) &ndash; drained oil quantity (l) x 1000 &divide; distance\ndriven = oil consumption (l/1000 km)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n \n\n<hr width=\"200\" align=\"left\">\n<a name=\"1\">1</a> ) Measuring cylinder (transparent) with a volume\nof 1 to 2 litres. <br>\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  \r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td ></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
