<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Clutches, Gearboxes</p>

<p class="topic">8.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Before operations involving a risk of electrical short circuit,
the ground cable must be disconnected from the battery.</li>

<li>Never pull on cable when disconnecting wiring harness plugs.
Carefully release locking mechanism at wiring harness plug.</li>

<li>During removal/installation of engine or transmission, it must
be ensured that all ground connections are correctly routed.
Starting the engine with missing ground connections destroys the
control units.</li>

<li>Always replace seals, seal rings, O-rings and retaining
elements &ndash; do not overstretch retaining rings.</li>

<li>During all transmission operations, ensure utmost cleanliness
of components and tools to avoid transmission malfunction.</li>

<li>Carefully clean all removed components and check for wear or
damage. Check grooves and seat surface for foreign objects, burr
formation or damage.</li>

<li>Only install housing components with sealing compound
designated for this purpose.</li>

<li>The Service Instructions list the transmission components which
require coating with transmission fluid prior to installation.</li>

<li>Insert bearings, gaskets and seal rings with assembly
grease.</li>

<li>Bolted connections with designated angle of rotation specified
in the Service Instructions (anti-fatigue bolts) must be replaced
with new parts if removed.</li>

<li>The inner thread of screw connections that have been used with
sealing compound must be recut and the outer thread cleaned. Use
screws with new sealing compound.</li>

<li>Always replace self-locking nuts.</li>

<li>If threads in aluminium components are stripped or damaged,
these parts are not necessarily unusable. In most cases these
threads can be repaired with commercially available Helicoil
inserts.</li>

<li>Only use approved special fluids &ndash; never re-use drained
fluid.</li>

<li>Disconnecting the ground cable from the battery automatically
erases the contents of certain electronic system memories (e.g.
electric window winder, time and date). After reconnecting the
ground cable to the battery, these volatile memories must be
reprogrammed and audio equipment decoded.</li>

<li>When working on the hydraulic system, the utmost cleanliness
must be observed. The system is very sensitive to contamination.
Dirt particles cause function impairment, damage and destruction of
the hydraulic system. In addition, excessive wear may occur and
signs of wear may appear on components.</li>

<li>If repairs cannot be carried out immediately, seal open
components or cover them carefully.</li>

<li>The thread of screw connections that have been used with
sealing compound must be recut. Coat screws with sealing compound
before use.</li>

<li>When replacing microencapsulated screws, there is no need for
the use of additional locking compounds when installing.</li>

<li>Check all components for signs of wear and replace if
necessary.</li>

<li>Place removed parts on clean surfaces only and cover with foil
- never use lint-producing cloths.</li>

<li>Only install clean parts. Remove new parts from their packaging
immediately prior to installation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">8.2 Clutch, clutch hydraulics</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Friction surfaces of the clutch linings must not come into
contact with lubricants.</li>

<li>Install clutch hoses and lines in the designated brackets.</li>

<li>After working on the clutch hydraulics, evacuate and check all
connections for leaks.</li>

<li>Brake fluid is a hazardous substance and must be treated,
stored and identified accordingly.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Brake fluid is flammable &ndash; fire hazard.</li>

<li>Explosive mixtures are easily formed from brake fluid
fumes.</li>

<li>Brake fluid is toxic &ndash; do not inhale brake fluid vapour
or swallow brake fluid.</li>

<li>Brake fluid can cause irritation of the skin &ndash; use rubber
gloves.</li>

<li>Escaping brake fluid must be rinsed away immediately with
water.</li>
</ul>

<li>Never re-use drained brake fluid.</li>

<li>When disposing of brake fluid, never mix it with other
substances (e.g. used oil). Observe national legislation
guidelines.</li>

<li>Before removing hydraulic system components, thoroughly clean
connections and their immediate vicinity.</li>

<li>Lines must not be opened or released when the engine is
running.</li>

<li>All pressure lines must be tightened to the specified
torque.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">8.3 Automatic Transmission</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Always test the stall speed in AT vehicles. During the test,
high drive forces are kept under control exclusively by the
vehicle's brake system. This test may not be performed for longer
than a few seconds or otherwise the automatic transmission will
overheat. Place brake wedges in front of and behind the drive
wheels to secure the vehicle against rolling. Have a second person
monitor the wheels and brake wedges during the test.</li>

<li>Before repairing the automatic transmission, always run a test
using the diagnostic tester in conjunction with the applicable
Checking Procedures for the relevant transmission.</li>

<li>If residual clutch lining, metal chips, soiling or deposits are
found in the transmission oil after repairing the transmission, the
transmission must be completely dismantled and carefully cleaned.
Blow out all parts and oil channels and blow dry.</li>
