<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Braking Systems</p>

<p class="topic">5.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Operations on the brake system may be performed by certified,
qualified personnel only. This is assured at all Opel/Vauxhall
affiliated dealerships.</li>

<li>Before operations involving a risk of electrical short circuit,
the ground cable must be disconnected from the battery.</li>

<li>After completion of work on the brake system, braking
efficiency must be checked before re-using the vehicle.</li>

<li>Use of cover discs or brake dust guards is prohibited, as
otherwise overheating can cause the formation of bubbles in the
brake fluid and consequent brake system failure. In addition, the
rubber sleeves in the brake callipers and wheel brake cylinders may
be destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">5.2 Repair Information</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>When replacing brake discs, always install new brake linings.
Use original Opel/Vauxhall brake linings. Always replace all brake
linings or brake shoes on one axle. After replacing brake linings,
notify the owner of the vehicle that unnecessary severe braking
must be avoided for the next 200 km.</li>

<li>Material-removing work on the brake calliper pistons and bores
is not permitted. Corroded pistons in the brake calliper may be
cleaned with brake fluid or alcohol. No sharp-edged tools may be
used in operations on these components.</li>

<li>The thread of screw connections that have been used with
sealing compound must be cleaned or recut. Use screws with sealing
compound.</li>

<li>Do not perform machining operations, when overhauling brake
components. Only used approved assembly paste.</li>

<li>Friction surfaces of brake pads, brake linings, brake discs and
brake drums must not come into contact with lubricants. Only use
special brake cleaner from "Aftersales".</li>

<li>There must be no dirt between brake disc and wheel hub when
installing the brake disc. The contact surfaces must be even and
free from burrs.</li>

<li>Install brake hoses in designated brackets &ndash; ensure
correct, twist-free routing of the hoses.</li>

<li>After working on the brake system hydraulics, evacuate and
check all connections for leaks.</li>

<li>Vehicles with ABS:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>When welding in the immediate vicinity of control units,
disconnect wiring harness plugs and remove control units.</li>

<li>ABS control units can be damaged at temperatures above 80
&deg;C/176 &deg;F.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p class="topic">5.3 Brake Fluid</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Brake fluid is a hazardous substance and must be treated,
stored and identified accordingly.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Brake fluid is flammable &ndash; fire hazard.</li>

<li>Explosive mixtures are easily formed from brake fluid
fumes.</li>

<li>Brake fluid is toxic &ndash; do not inhale brake fluid vapour
or swallow brake fluid.</li>

<li>Brake fluid can cause irritation of the skin &ndash; use rubber
gloves.</li>

<li>Escaping brake fluid must be rinsed away immediately with
water.</li>
</ul>

<li>Never re-use drained brake fluid.</li>

<li>Brake fluid attacks paintwork.</li>

<li>When disposing of brake fluid, never mix it with other
substances (e.g. used oil). Observe national legislation
guidelines.</li>
