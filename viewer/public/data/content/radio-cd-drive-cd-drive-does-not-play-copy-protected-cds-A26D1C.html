<h2 class="remedy">Remedy:</h2>

<pre>
During the development phase of most on the market available CD-drives
copy-protection was not known. Due to the fact that the music industry
installed a copy protection on some music CDs to avoid that they can be
copied on a PC, most of the market available CD-drives can not play them
anymore because their CD-drive is similar to a PC-drive. 
The CD-drive manufacturers are able to consider current copy protection
methods in their new developments. 
But they can not guarantee for their CD.drives to be able to play all
CD-types because the music industry still permanently changes their copy
protection methods. 
Based on these facts exchange of CD-radios is not be supported by the car
manufacturers because the CD-drives were developed according to the
international Audio Compact Disc Standard (Red Book Standard).
