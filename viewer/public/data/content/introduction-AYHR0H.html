<p class="title">Introduction</p>

<p>With their extremely complex chassis design, modern vehicles
provide a high degree of safety and driving comfort.</p>

<p>These new suspension constructions e.g. individual and multilink
suspension, require precise observation and setting of the figures
given by Opel/Vauxhall in order to ensure the required levels of
safety and driving comfort for all conditions, and also reduce tyre
wear to a minimum.</p>

<p>Continued development of new suspension, and the improvement of
existing designs, has meant that setting tolerances have steadily
been reduced in recent years. Consequently the requirements imposed
on manufacturers of chassis alignment equipment for perfect
alignment are becoming more stringent. To meet these requirements,
for Opel/Vauxhall vehicles 4-wheel alignment has been stipulated
since the introduction of the Vectra-B.</p>

<p>This chapter explains what we mean by chassis alignment, what
its purpose is and how we know when an alignment is required.</p>
