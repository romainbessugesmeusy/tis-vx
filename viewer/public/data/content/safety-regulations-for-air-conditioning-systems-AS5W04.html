<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Air Conditioning
Systems</p>

<p class="topic">2.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Operations on air conditioning systems must be performed by
certified, trained and qualified personnel. This is assured at all
Opel/Vauxhall affiliated dealerships.</li>

<li>Do not work on the refrigerant circuit in the workshop pit
since gaseous refrigerant is heavier than air and can thus collect
in high concentrations in the pit.</li>

<li>The workplace must be well ventilated.</li>

<li>Liquid refrigerant that has evaporated under atmospheric
pressure may cause freezing if it comes into contact with parts of
the body. Do not point quick-release mechanism in direction of body
when removing service hoses - residual refrigerant may emerge.</li>

<li>Refrigerant must not be exposed to naked flames or incandescent
bodies (e.g. during welding operations). Burning refrigerant
releases respiratory poisons.</li>

<li>Wear suitable protective goggles and gloves when working on the
refrigerant circuit.</li>

<li>Rubbing of the eyes must be avoided if contact with evaporating
refrigerant occurs. Rinse eyes and other affected parts of the body
with large amounts of cold water for several minutes and then seek
immediate medical attention.</li>

<li>Keep refrigerant bottles away from direct heat (e.g. incident
solar radiation) and avoid temperatures in excess of 50 °C/122
°F – risk of explosion.</li>

<li>When filling refrigerant bottles, the specifications on the
individual bottles concerning maximum permissible weight must be
observed. Otherwise there is a danger of explosion.</li>

<li>Always reseal refillable refrigerant bottles immediately when
not in use. Seal the cut-off valve and safety plug with a screw cap
to protect these parts from damage – danger of injury.</li>

<li>Never interchange or mix different types of refrigerant.</li>

<li>When cleaning the engine compartment using a high pressure /
steam cleaner, do not direct the jet directly onto air conditioning
system components.</li>

<li>The air conditioning system must be evacuated before carrying
out painting work during which the vehicle is present in the drying
oven for more than 20 minutes at temperatures exceeding 80
°C.</li>

<li>PAG oil (compressor lubricant) is extremely hygroscopic and
must be stored in an air-sealed container.</li>

<li>It is not permitted to re-use compressor lubricant.</li>

<li>When replacing components of the refrigerant circuit, e.g.
lines, receiver-dryer, evaporator or compressor, the separation
points must be sealed in order to prevent moisture entering the
refrigerant circuit.</li>

<li>A completely or partially assembled system must not be left
unconnected for any longer than is absolutely necessary.</li>

<li>When testing the function of heating, ventilation and AC
systems, never reach into the mechanical components of the heating
or AC system.</li>

<li>The basic setting of the expansion valve must not be
changed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">2.2 Repair Information</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Repairs to the air conditioning are to be performed immediately
after evacuation, as otherwise refrigerant in the system can
evaporate causing a build-up of pressure – danger of
injury.</li>

<li>Connections with missing catches and parts that have been
penetrated by dirt, grease or dampness must not be installed. Only
install pipes, hoses and units if the connections are in perfect
condition.</li>

<li>In order to equalise temperatures and prevent moisture from
condensing, the AC components must be at room temperature before
installation.</li>

<li>Only remove sealing caps (plugs) immediately before connecting
the fitted parts. Keep the sealing caps of new parts for use in
later maintenance operations.</li>

<li>When replacing components of the refrigerant circuit (e.g.
lines, receiver-dryer, evaporator) the compressor lubricant
remaining in the removed component must be replaced by new
compressor lubricant when refilling the refrigerant circuit.</li>

<li>The receiver-dryer must not be connected until all other parts
of the system have been connected.</li>

<li>Use new O-rings.</li>

<li>When using green O-rings: coat all O-rings with the fuel that
is specified in the work operations before assembling.</li>

<li>Compressor connections must be sealed immediately after
removing the compressor. In warranty cases, returned compressors
which have not been sealed cannot be accepted.</li>

<li>For depressurised refrigerant lines/systems, it is essential
that the receiver-dryer cartridge is replaced.</li>

<li>Only use vehicle-specific synthetic compressor lubricants
approved by Opel/Vauxhall – otherwise, damage to the
compressor may result.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">Run-in Procedure</p>

<p>The following run-in procedure must be observed after installing
a new compressor:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Open all the air vents on the instrument panel.</li>

<li>Start vehicle engine and allow idle speed to stabilise (approx.
5 secs.).</li>

<li>Switch fan to maximum speed.</li>

<li>Switch on AC system and allow to run continuously for at least
2 minutes at an engine speed below 1500 rpm.</li>
</ul>
