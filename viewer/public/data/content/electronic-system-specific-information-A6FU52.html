<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Trouble Code Features</b><br>In a few cases, the diagnostic tester may display a trouble code status or description that looks unfamiliar. Trouble code status and trouble code description are concerned:<br><br>Trouble Code Status:<br>Instead of the known PRESENT, NOT PRESENT and INTERMITTENT message, you may read UNKNOWN in the tester display. This tells you that the diagnostic software or control unit contains a piece of incorrect information that is unknown to the diagnostic tester and that it is unable to read or evaluate. Both the trouble code number and the trouble code text are not changed in this case.<br><br>Trouble Code Text:<br>The diagnostic tester displays a trouble code number that is unknown to the diagnostic software, or the trouble code number and fault symptom do not lead to a plausible result when they are being diagnosed. In both cases, the diagnostic tester will display TROUBLE CODE NOT DEFINED.<br><br>A combination of both above described messages is also possible. There are basically two reasons for this: the diagnostic program you are using is outdated, or there is a fault in the electronic control unit.<br><br>All of the above mentioned special cases have one thing in common: The corresponding fault can not be removed by means of a diagnostic tester function.

    <b>Data List Parameter</b><br>Depending on the vehicle/system configuration it is possible that some data list parameters or test steps, although they are listed in this checking procedure, are not shown on the diagnostic tester display. In that case, these data list parameters are not valid for this vehicle/system configuration.
