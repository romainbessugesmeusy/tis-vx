      "text": "During the development phase of most on the market available CD-drives\ncopy-protection was not known. Due to the fact that the music industry\ninstalled a copy protection on some music CDs to avoid that they can be\ncopied on a PC, most of the market available CD-drives can not play them\nanymore because their CD-drive is similar to a PC-drive. \nThe CD-drive manufacturers are able to consider current copy protection\nmethods in their new developments. \nBut they can not guarantee for their CD.drives to be able to play all\nCD-types because the music industry still permanently changes their copy\nprotection methods. \nBased on these facts exchange of CD-radios is not be supported by the car\nmanufacturers because the CD-drives were developed according to the\ninternational Audio Compact Disc Standard (Red Book Standard)."
