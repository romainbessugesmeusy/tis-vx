<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Painting Operations</p>

<p class="topic">11.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Preliminary work for paintable surfaces:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Provide paintable surfaces.</li>

<li>The paint shop (painter) prepares the surface to be
painted.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>This comprises:</li>

<li>a maximum of 3 thin filler coats for bolted parts</li>

<li>a maximum of 4 thin filler coats for welded parts</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>In order to protect electronic components and plastic parts, a
temperature of 80 °C/176 °F (Speedster/VX220, 60 °C/140
°F) must not be exceeded during drying operations in painting
plants.</li>

<li>Protect natural gas system components from direct heat (e.g.
incident solar radiation) and never allow heating to temperatures
in excess of 60 °C/140 °F – risk of explosion.</li>

<li>For repair operations in which temperatures in excess of 60
°C/140 °F may be encountered (e.g. during paint drying in
the combined spray / drying plant, in the paint dryer or when
drying with infrared radiation), the vehicle's pressurised gas
tanks with carrier frame must first be removed and the other
natural gas system components must be completely discharged and
flushed with inert gas.</li>

<li>The compressed air that is used must be free of oil and water
particles.</li>

<li>Process solvent-containing substances either in painting booths
or in areas with suitable extraction. Water-based paints also
contain solvents. Failure to follow these instructions leads to
risk of personal injury, especially respiratory injuries.</li>

<li>Avoid naked flames. An adequate number of fire extinguishers
must be available and routinely serviced.</li>

<li>Respiratory protection</li>

<li>Use dust masks, active carbon masks or fresh-air masks,
depending on the type of operation being performed.</li>

<li>When dry-grinding, use grinding machines with integral
dust-extraction unit.</li>

<li>Dispose of paint and solvent residues, vacuum unit filter,
grinding dust, etc. according to national regulations.</li>
</ul>
