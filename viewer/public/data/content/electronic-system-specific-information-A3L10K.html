  <li>
    <b>Trouble Code Features</b><br>In a few cases, the diagnostic tester may display a trouble code status or description that looks unfamiliar:<br><br>Trouble Code Status:<br>Instead of the known PRESENT, NOT PRESENT (and INTERMITTENT) message, you may read UNKNOWN DTC in the tester display. This tells you that the diagnostic software or control unit contains a piece of incorrect information that is unknown to the diagnostic tester and that it is unable to read or evaluate. Both the trouble code number and the trouble code text are not changed in this case.<br><br>The above mentioned special cases can not be removed by means of a diagnostic tester function.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Data List Parameter</b><br>Depending on the vehicle/system configuration it is possible that some data list parameters or test steps, although they are listed in this checking procedure, are not shown on the diagnostic tester display. In that case, these data list parameters are not valid for this vehicle/system configuration.
  </li>
  <li>Immobiliser and Anti-Theft Warning System installed<br>Though there is a programming function "Programming Immobiliser Output" available, it is necessary to program the immobiliser always as with "No Anti-Theft Warning System". For this particular model, the functionality of the immobiliser to send a disarming signal to the anti-theft warning system has been omitted. On this basis the immobiliser has to be always programmed with ''No Anti-Theft Warning System'. If programming is performed faulty, PRESENT trouble codes will be set, which can not be erased.<br>The immobiliser should be programmed with "No Anti-Theft Warning System" to erase the trouble codes with status PRESENT.
