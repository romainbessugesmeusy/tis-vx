It enables quick and reliable\ndetermination of the current battery condition. This is important\nfor in-vehicle battery diagnosis as well as for the diagnosis of\nstored batteries. For diagnosis of installed batteries, the use of\nthis tester does not require disconnection or removal of the\nbattery.After completion of the test, the battery tester indicates\nthe battery condition in the form of test result, output as plain\ntext. In addition, a test code is output for the purpose of result\nsummarisation for warranty cases.For these warranty cases, the\noutput test code must be hand-written on the warranty claim.The\nsafety regulations must be observed during the charging procedures\nresulting from the test.The battery must be disconnected during\ncharging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Note:</p>\n\n<p>Due to \"acid layering\", a battery which has been charged with a\nlow charge voltage (&le; 14.9 V) may be evaluated as \"good\" by the\ntester, even though the battery eye remains black. These batteries\nmust not be replaced, as the battery eye will change to \"green\"\nduring driving due to mixing of the battery fluid.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"gt-notice\">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Storage:</p>\n\n<p>Batteries which are stored for long periods must be recharged\napproximately every six months.In the case of stored vehicles, the\nground connection must be disconnected and the battery must also be\nrecharged every six months.When using stored batteries, those with\nthe longest storage time must be used first.</p>\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr><td><hr size=\"1\" ></td></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td ><a id=\"relatedlus\"></a><table ><tr ><th colspan=\"2\" >Related Literature Units</th></tr><tr ><td >-</td><td ><a href=\"javascript:TFormSubmit('AJCC19PB1JRB1','1','AJCC19PB1JRB1','_top')\" id=\"AJCC19PB1JRB1\" >General Warnings and Safety Regulations</a></td></tr><tr ><td >-</td><td ><a href=\"javascript:TFormSubmit('A2AC1VKB16LB1','1','A2AC1VKB16LB1','_top')\" id=\"A2AC1VKB16LB1\" >Safety Regulations for Electrical/Electronic Systems</a></td></tr></table></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
