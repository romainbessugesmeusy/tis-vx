<p class="title">Cylinder head height, check</p>

<p>Special service tools required:</p>

<p>Caliper gauge</p>

<p><span class="gt-notice">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The
engine-specific values can be found in the corresponding "Technical
Data".</p>

<p class="topic">Caution</p>

<p>Remove gasket residue and clean sealing surfaces. No sharp-edged
tools may be used when cleaning. Ensure that the cylinder head
sealing surface is not damaged.</p>

<p>Measure height of cylinder head from cover-side sealing surface
to block-side sealing surface.</p>

<p>Dimensions and tolerances are given in "Technical Data" in the
corresponding Service Instruction. If the values measured do not
correspond to those specified, the cylinder head should be
replaced.</p>

<p><span class="gt-notice">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Planing is not
permitted on multivalve cylinder heads (4 valves per cylinder).
These cylinder heads must never be subjected to planing under any
circumstances.</p>

<p class="topic">Caution</p>

<p>Planing is permitted only on petrol engines with 2 valves per
cylinder.</p>

<p>It must be noted that planing of the cylinder head is permitted
only within the given measurement tolerances. Furthermore, after
planing the valve recess must be checked. After planing also check
whether different thickness head gaskets must be used. Dimensions
and tolerances are given in "Technical Data" in the corresponding
Service Instruction.</p>
