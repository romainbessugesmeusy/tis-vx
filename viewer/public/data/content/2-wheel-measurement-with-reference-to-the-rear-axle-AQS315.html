axle</p>

<p>With this measurement procedure, in addition to the normal
2-wheel-measurement, the axis of symmetry is included in the
measurement. However, the front and rear axles have to be set
separately from each other.</p>

<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
Alignment machines with 2-wheel alignment with reference to the
rear axle are not approved for Opel/Vauxhall vehicles.</p>

<p>This measurement process includes e.g. visual-mechanical
alignment machines.</p>
