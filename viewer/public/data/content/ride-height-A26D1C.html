<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For the
rear axle of the Vectra-C there are several settings which relate
to the different vehicle ride heights. The ride height given (l) is
measured form the centre of the wheel hub to the lower edge of the
wheel arch on each vehicle side. Any slope of the vehicle caused by
different ride heights on the left and right rear axle must be
compensated. The vehicle must stand horizontal at the rear by
dividing the weights in the rear onto the higher vehicle side. The
height difference between left and right vehicle side must not
exceed <span class="tech-spec">1 mm</span> .</p>
