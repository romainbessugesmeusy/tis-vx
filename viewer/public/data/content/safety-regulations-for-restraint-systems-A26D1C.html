<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Restraint Systems</p>

<p class="topic">13.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Operations on restraint systems must be performed by trained
and qualified personnel certified under the Explosives Act. This is
assured at all Opel/Vauxhall affiliated dealerships.</li>

<li>The restraint system incorporates the following
components:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Driver and passenger airbags (subsequently referred to as
driver and passenger airbags)</li>

<li>Side airbag (subsequently referred to as side airbag)</li>

<li>Curtain airbag (subsequently referred to as curtain
airbag)</li>

<li>Belt/belt buckle tensioner with seat belt</li>

<li>Airbag control unit</li>

<li>Decentralised front airbag sensor</li>

<li>Decentralised side-airbag sensor</li>

<li>Mounting plate for decentralised front airbag sensor</li>

<li>Installation plate for decentralised side-airbag sensor</li>

<li>Contact unit</li>

<li>Steering Column Electronic Module / Column Integration Module
(CIM)</li>

<li>Wiring harness, with yellow or orange identification</li>

<li>Sensor pad</li>

<li>Airbag system indicator lights</li>

<li>Indicator light for child safety seat with transponders</li>
</ul>

<li>The handling of pyrotechnic units (airbag and pyrotechnic seat
belt tensioners) is subject to varying national legislation which
must be observed at all times.</li>

<li>The version with driver's airbag can be identified with the
"Airbag" logo</li>

<li>The version with passenger's airbag can be recognised by the
inscription "Airbag" above the glove compartment and by the round
child seat warning sticker on the side of the instrument panel
(passenger's door open) or by the rectangular warning sticker on
the sun visor.</li>

<li>If, despite having a passenger's airbag fitted, there is no
sticker at the corresponding point, this must be applied if there
is no indication on the sun visor.</li>

<li>The issue of loose warning stickers to final customers is not
permissible.</li>

<li>Versions with a side airbag can be recognised by the "Airbag"
sticker on the outside of the front seat backrests. The inscription
is engraved into the airbag cover (all cars, except Corsa-B). A
material label containing this inscription is stitched onto the
front seat backrest in the Corsa-B.</li>

<li>The version with curtain airbag can be recognised by the
lettering "Airbag" on the A and C-pillar panelling or the
B-pillar.</li>

<li>Service installation of accessories in the deployment area of
the airbag and storage of objects on the passenger's airbag cover
is not permitted. Consoles for phone receivers, drink holders,
CD/cassette trays, additional mirrors, etc., which have not been
authorised by Opel/Vauxhall may be torn off and propelled through
the passenger compartment when the airbag is deployed &ndash;
danger of injury.</li>

<li>Objects (e.g. clothing) must kept away from the deployment area
of the side airbag, as they may affect the functioning of the side
airbag and be propelled through the passenger compartment &ndash;
danger of injury. Only use seat covers approved by Opel/Vauxhall
for the corresponding vehicle type with side airbag.</li>

<li>Objects (e.g. clothing) must kept away from the deployment area
of the curtain airbag, as they may affect the functioning of the
curtain airbag. Only light items of clothing with empty pockets and
without coat hanger are permissible. Objects in the items of
clothing may endanger the occupants if the curtain airbag is
deployed.</li>

<li>The sale of pyrotechnic units is only permitted to authorised
third parties in accordance with explosives legislation.</li>

<li>Components of the restraint system must never be interchanged
or replaced by used parts.</li>

<li>Repair work on restraint system components is not permitted.
These components must never be forced open or modified.</li>

<li>The pyrotechnic units and airbag control unit are sensitive to
impact. They must not be installed if they have fallen from a
height exceeding 80 cm.</li>

<li>Cables connected to gas generators for pyrotechnic units must
not be repaired, removed, replaced or cross-connected.</li>

<li>The airbag units and the airbag control unit must not be
subjected to a temperature exceeding 85 &deg;C even for short
periods.</li>

<li>Always disconnect the ground cable from the battery when
performing welding or soldering operations on the vehicle. Always
attach the earth terminal of the welding equipment to the immediate
vicinity of the welding point.</li>

<li>For soldering or welding operations in the immediate vicinity
of sensitive components (e.g. electrical/electronic/pyrotechnic
components, control units, wiring harnesses and airbags), the
components must be removed.</li>

<li>For soldering or welding operations on front doors or door
pillars / B-pillars in the vicinity of the side airbag sensor
(vehicle specific), this must be removed (store in a dry and safe
place). For minor installing or body operations (no use of, e.g.
slide hammer) in this area, switching ignition OFF suffices. Remove
the ignition key and keep in a safe place during the repair
operation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">13.2 Transportation and Storage</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Pyrotechnic units may only be purchased, transported and
stored, according to the safety regulations, by trained personnel
of a franchised Opel/Vauxhall dealer or authorised Opel/Vauxhall
Service Dealership.</li>

<li>Pyrotechnic units may be returned only if one of the following
six conditions has been fulfilled:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>In accident-damaged vehicles that are not to be repaired and
pyrotechnic units that have not been deployed, an attempt must
first be made to deploy the units in the vehicle with the relevant
special service tools, as described in the Service Instructions.
These units must be returned as non-deployable pyrotechnic units
only following an unsuccessful ignition procedure. Local disposal
of non-deployed pyrotechnic units is prohibited.</li>

<li>Incorrect deliveries</li>

<li>Electrical defect (e.g. as determined by diagnostic
tester)</li>

<li>Electromechanical defect (e.g. retaining lugs or on wiring
harness plug housing damaged)</li>

<li>Mechanical damage (e.g. if pyrotechnic unit has fallen from a
height exceeding 80 cm)</li>

<li>Visual damage (e.g. cover panel scratched or damaged)</li>
</ul>

<li>The units may be returned in the original packaging only. If
this is not available, it must be ordered.</li>

<li>The pyrotechnic units may be returned to the following address
only (the same address is applicable for procuring the original
packaging):</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Adam Opel GmbH,</li>

<li>c/o Verpackungsservice Schollmayer GmbH,</li>

<li>Am Kupferwerk 26,</li>

<li>D-65462 Ginsheim-Gustavsburg,</li>

<li>Germany</li>

<li>
<li>Telephone: +49 6134 2857-10</li>

<li>Fax: +49 6134 2857-79</li>
</ul>

<li>For vehicle repairs requiring longer periods of time,
non-activated, removed airbags must be stored under lock and key.
Storage with other hazardous materials (e.g. paint) is prohibited.
The storage area must identified with the corresponding hazard
symbol and contain suitable fire prevention equipment.</li>

<li>Deployed pyrotechnic units can be disposed of as normal
refuse.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">13.3 Registration</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Until now, Aftersales parts have been accompanied by
registration cards and an envelope for registering replaced
restraint system components.</li>

<li>As of now, filling out and returning the registration cards to
Adam Opel GmbH, R&uuml;sselsheim is no longer necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">13.4 Diagnosis</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>If the pyrotechnic units are in perfect working order the
airbag indicator lamp must illuminate when the ignition is switched
on and go off again after about four seconds. If the light does not
go off or it comes on whilst driving the vehicle, there is a
fault.</li>

<li>The system must only be tested using the diagnostic
tester.</li>

<li>During the diagnosis or programming of airbag systems, the
following sequence must be followed:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Ignition OFF</li>

<li>Connect the diagnosis tester to the ALDL connector</li>

<li>Ignition ON</li>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Note: During diagnosis or programming (the period between
switching on and switching off the diagnostic tester) no persons
are permitted in the vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<li>Switch on diagnosis tester</li>

<li>Select system, follow menu</li>

<li>De-select system</li>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Note: If it is not possible to exit the "Airbag" menu the
ground cable must first be disconnected from the battery and the
negative terminal covered (exceptional case). Wait for one minute
until the capacitor in the airbag control unit has discharged.</li>
</ul>

<li>Switch off diagnosis tester</li>

<li>Ignition OFF</li>

<li>Detach diagnosis tester from ALDL connector</li>
</ul>

<li>If there are no fault codes in the airbag system, a diagnosis
in the vehicle (e.g. seat occupied detection test) is
permitted.</li>

<li>Vehicles with active fault codes must not be handed over to the
customer &ndash; danger for occupants.</li>

<li>In order to prevent unintentional deployment, never use a test
lamp or multimeter to perform measurements on the pyrotechnic units
&ndash; danger of injury.</li>

<li>Connections for pyrotechnic units and control unit must be
disconnected when using test lamp or multimeter to check the wiring
harness &ndash; danger of injury.</li>

<li>If there is bodywork damage in the vicinity of the
decentralised front airbag sensors, inspect the securing panels and
replace if damaged.</li>

<li>Testing with TECH2 (four test operations) and an Opel/Vauxhall
child safety cradle with transponders (part no. 09 121 858,
catalogue no. 17 46 704) is required whenever the passenger seat
upholstery is replaced in vehicles with seat occupied detection <a
href="javascript:TFormSubmit('A1JH1ATG1N2H1','1','A1JH1ATG1N2H1','_top')"><img src="/data/assets/images/6dfe3dad03d5.gif"
border="0" height="10" width="20" alt="LUREF_1.gif"></a> .</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>If the test proves unsuccessful, the seat occupied detection is
not suitable for operation. The vehicle must not be handed over to
the customer.</li>

<li>Exception: Driving is permitted for workshop staff, provided
that the passenger's seat remains unoccupied.</li>
</ul>

<li>Always replace damaged parts.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>If only the pyrotechnic belt/belt lock tensioner are deployed
in an accident, these must be replaced by new components.</li>

<li>Control units may only be re-used if fault-free.</li>

<li>Checking and replacing the seat belt system (seat belts with
guide rollers and belt locks) after accident damage. The following
three different cases must be taken into account:</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>Very slight accident damage: (minor accidents, e.g. parking
damage). No checks or replacements are necessary in these
cases.</li>

<li>Following minor accident damage (e.g. seat belt tensioner not
deployed) check ease of unwinding and check belt buckle operation;
there must be no damage to seat belt (e.g. tears, shiny areas
caused by overstretching) - otherwise replace affected component.
The same applies to Opel/ISO fixed belt systems, otherwise replace
affected component. The same applies to child seat belt systems,
otherwise replace child seat.</li>

<li>For other accident damage in general, replace respective seat
belt system that has been burdened by a person or child seat during
an accident. Belt systems must also be replaced if it is
subsequently impossible to conclusively determine whether they were
burdened. These measures must be carried out in all cases where a
seat belt tensioner has been deployed or where side damage has
occurred. The same applies to the Opel/ISO fixed belt system. The
same also applies to child seat belt systems. Otherwise replace the
child seat. Non-burdened seat belts should be tested as described
in b).</li>
</ol>

<li>The airbag steering wheel may be replaced with steering wheels
approved by Opel/Vauxhall only.</li>

<li>Always put airbag units down with the padded side on top.</li>

<li>Always transport or carry airbag units with the padded side
facing away from the body.</li>

<li>The impact cushion of the steering wheel and the instrument
panel padding must not be cemented or otherwise altered. Under no
circumstances may cleaning agents (aggressive materials) or grease
be used &ndash; clean with a dry or moistened cloth and using a
cleaning agent approved by Opel/Vauxhall only.</li>

<li>Before installation, check once more that the ground cable is
disconnected from the battery, the negative terminal is masked and
the ignition key is in the OFF position.</li>

<li>After completing work on restraint systems, reconnect battery;
no persons should be present in the vehicle.</li>

<li>Disconnecting the ground cable from the battery automatically
erases the contents of certain electronic system memories (e.g.
electric window winder, time and date). After reconnecting the
ground cable to the battery, these volatile memories must be
reprogrammed and audio equipment decoded.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">13.5 Deploying Pyrotechnic Units in the
Vehicle</p>

<p>Deploy using provided special tool <span class=
"tool">KM-799-B</span> and suitable adapter. Connect power source
right at the end.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Park vehicle in open area.</li>

<li>Before deployment of pyrotechnic units:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Ignition OFF</li>

<li>Disconnect the ground cable from battery and mask the negative
terminal.</li>

<li>Wait for one minute until the capacitor in the airbag control
unit has discharged.</li>
</ul>

<li>Remove all loose objects from the airbag deployment area.</li>

<li>Vehicles with belt tensioners only: fasten seatbelt into belt
lock.</li>

<li>Connect special tool <span class="tool">KM-799-B</span> to
vehicle using suitable adapter.</li>

<li>Open the front side windows and close the doors.</li>

<li>Stand approx. 10 m in front of the vehicle &ndash; this also
applies to uninvolved bystanders. Provide advance warning regarding
potential noise level.</li>

<li>Connect the voltage source and deploy the pyrotechnic
unit.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Note: Disconnect the voltage source if the unit fails to deploy
and approach the vehicle only after a period of 5 minutes. Further
information is available in the section "Transport and
Storage".</li>
</ul>

<li>Allow deployed airbag units to cool for 15 minutes before
removing &ndash; danger of injury.</li>
