<p class="title">Step C - Preparations, General</p>

<p class="topic">General</p>

<p>The purpose of the wiring harness repair method described is to
replace wiring harness replacements, that have previously been
necessary, as far as possible with economic repairs.</p>

<p>This means that after a fault has been located and classified
into the above-mentioned damage types, an estimate has to be made
as to which method of eliminating the fault is more economical:
repair or replacement of the wiring harness.</p>

<p>Usually, the labour for the repair must not be greater than the
existing time allowance for replacing the wiring harness. In
borderline cases, required additional time can be approved by
providing the "Y" voluntary code.</p>

<p>To assist you, the calculated time allowances for the wiring
harness repair alone, without additions for any necessary
supplementary operations, are given in section 6 "Time Allowances".
These are to be incorporated separately into the estimate.</p>

<p class="topic">C1 - Preparatory tests</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Faults on wiring harnesses and/or wiring harness plugs can be
located, for example, with the aid of circuit diagram information,
electrical system manuals or checking procedures.</li>

<li>Check whether the battery voltage is more than 11.5 V and
ensure a good ground connection.</li>

<li>Check whether it is permitted to repair the defective cable,
wiring harness or wiring harness plug (see section 2 "Area of
Application" <a href="#" class="unresolved-link" title="Link target not found: "><img src="/data/assets/images/6dfe3dad03d5.gif" border="0" height="10" width="20" alt="LUREF_1.gif"></a> <a href="#" class="unresolved-link" title="Link target not found: "><img src="/data/assets/images/6dfe3dad03d5.gif" border="0" height="10" width="20" alt="LUREF_1.gif"></a> and section 5 "Parts and Reference Lists").</li>

<li>Determine damage type, see section 2.1 "Repairable Damage" <a href="#" class="unresolved-link" title="Link target not found: "><img src="/data/assets/images/6dfe3dad03d5.gif" border="0" height="10" width="20" alt="LUREF_1.gif"></a> .</li>

<li>Use the "Time Allowances" in section 6 <a href="#" class="unresolved-link" title="Link target not found: "><img src="/data/assets/images/6dfe3dad03d5.gif" border="0" height="10" width="20" alt="LUREF_1.gif"></a> <a href="#" class="unresolved-link" title="Link target not found: "><img src="/data/assets/images/6dfe3dad03d5.gif" border="0" height="10" width="20" alt="LUREF_1.gif"></a> plus the time
allowances for any preparatory operations, such as disassembly of
panels or components, to estimate the time required for the repair
and compare this to the time allowances for replacing the complete
wiring harness.</li>

<li>Select the more economic method of eliminating the fault.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">C2 - Preparations on the vehicle</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Ignition OFF</li>

<li>Disconnect ground cable from battery and mask the negative
terminal.</li>

<li>Only for Vauxhall vehicles: Before disconnecting the ground
cable from the battery in Vauxhall vehicles, disarm the power
sounder: Disconnect ground cable from battery within 15 seconds of
switching off the ignition.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">C3 - Preparation of the repair zone</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Remove panelling and/or attaching parts.</li>

<li>Release wiring harness until it is possible to carry out the
operations correctly.</li>

<li>Remove ample wiring harness insulation.</li>
</ul>
