<h2 class="remedy">Remedy:</h2>

<p>In case of customer complaint replace the old cheater seal
against the new improved cheater seal.</p>

<pre>Note: In conjunction with the seal is a length of peel and stick seal
      extrusion (approximately 56cm) Part-No.: 93182346 /
      Cataloge-No.: 48 01 675. If this part is not fitted it will negate the 
      operational effectiveness of the new cheater seal.

</pre>

<pre>1. Fitting of the new cheater seal is as follows:
The cheater seal is glued into position using commercially purchased instant glue (superglue a primer may also be necessary). Carefully remove the old cheater seal (to avoid paint damage). Fit the new seal into same position (picture I, arrow).

</pre>

<br>  

<pre>2. Once the cheater seal has been fitted, without removing the backing (sticky) from the seal extrusion, locate one end under the lug (gutter) on the inboard face of the cheater seal.

</pre>

<pre>3. Using the lower edge of the cheater seal as a guide cut the upper edge of the seal extrusion to produce a neat join to the cheater seal.

</pre>

<pre>4. Thoroughly clean/degrease (use standard windscreen cleaner or similar) the area on the door where the seal extrusion is to be fitted to remove all dust/debris.

</pre>

<pre>5. Remove approximately 15cm of adhesive backing tape from the top edge of the extrusion and engage the upper edge of the extrusion under the lug (previously mentioned in No. 2 above).

</pre>

<pre>6. Gently press the seal onto the door inner, aligning the curved edge of the seal with the front edge of the mirror flag/door trim panel.

</pre>

<pre>7. At the curved section of the trim panel, remove backing tape and slightly stretch the seal to follow the profile of the door trim panel and press firmly into position. Ensure seal fits to the bottom of the panel, allowing any water to run away outside of the vehicle.

</pre>

<pre>8. Cut the lower edge of the seal at 90 degrees to produce a straight edge in line with the bottom of the door trim panel.

</pre>

<p>Some care points to consider:</p>

<p>- Ensure seal path is thoroughly cleaned prior to application of
seal.</p>

<pre>-Once the seal backing tape is removed the adhesive strip must not be    
  touched, as this will reduce the effectiveness of the adhesive.

</pre>

<pre>-Seal should be gently stretched into position to ensure that it does not
  become bunched and that the channel formed by the seal continues evenly 
  throughout the bend.
