Repeated\nstandard operations such as separation work or grinding down joint\nsurfaces are not especially described, because this work is routine\nworkshop practice.</li>\n\n<li>In regions where both the separation and also the connection\naffect the strength and road safety of the bodywork, the repair\nmethods described in this section must be adhered to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Repair Information &ndash; Preparatory Work</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>The locally applicable state laws and regulations must always\nbe observed when cutting or working with materials.</li>\n\n<li>Make sure that there is suitable extraction of vapour and\nparticles during all cutting, grinding and welding work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Always wear protective goggles and a filter mask when cutting\nor grinding.</li>\n\n<li>Fire Hazard &ndash; Observe the instructions on the containers\nwhen storing substances containing solvents.</li>\n\n<li>Fire and naked lights are forbidden.</li>\n\n<li>There must be enough fire extinguishers available, and they\nmust have been serviced regularly.</li>\n\n<li>Environmental and Health and Safety regulations must always be\nobserved.</li>\n\n<li>Because of the fire risk, protective sealants must not be\napplied to the area of the engine or exhaust system (e.g. catalytic\nconverter, oxygen sensors).</li>\n\n<li>In the case of accidents which indicate a high degree of stress\nto the chassis, irrespective of any measurement of the axle\ngeometry which has to be carried out, the following components must\nbe specifically checked:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul type=\"none\" class=\"none\">\n<li>steering and steering linkages for perfect operation from\nfull&ndash;lock to full&ndash;lock.

Damaged components\n(e.g. micro&ndash;encapsulated bolts) must be replaced by new\ncomponents.</li>\n\n<li>The battery ground cable must be disconnected for any work\nwhere there is a danger of an electrical short&ndash;circuit.</li>\n\n<li>Electronic control units may be damaged at temperatures above\n<span class=\"tech-spec\">80 &deg;C/176 &deg;F</span> .</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"topic\">Safety instruction, body panels</p>\n\n<p>Sitting on body panels or distorting them in any other way is\nnot permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Body panels must not be excessively distorted, otherwise the gel\ncoat may split. These splits may only become visible after three\nmonths.</p>\n\n<p>The outer surfaces of panels are sealed with a thin layer of\nsynthetic resin, which provides a smooth base for paint\napplication.</p>\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr><td><hr size=\"1\" ></td></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td ><a id=\"relatedlus\"></a><table ><tr ><th colspan=\"2\" >Related Literature Units</th></tr><tr ><td >-</td><td ><a href=\"javascript:TFormSubmit('A8N81AW71RW71','1','A8N81AW71RW71','_top')\" id=\"A8N81AW71RW71\" >General Warnings and Safety Regulations</a></td></tr><tr ><td >-</td><td ><a href=\"javascript:TFormSubmit('AZI81B281CZ71','1','AZI81B281CZ71','_top')\" id=\"AZI81B281CZ71\" >Safety Regulations for the Bodywork</a></td></tr></table></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
