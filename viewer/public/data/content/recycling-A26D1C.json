Opel has\nfollowed this principle for many years and, in 1979, became the\nfirst German automobile manufacturer to mark all parts made of\nsynthetic materials with internationally standardised materials\nsymbols, indicting the synthetic material used in each case.\nRecyclable plastic parts can be separated out and grouped together\nby checking their materials symbol.</p>\n\n<p class=\"para-before-list\">Overview of laws and regulations (which\nmay differ in other countries):</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Flammable Liquids Regulation</li>\n\n<li>Anti-pollution Laws (regulation on the prevention of harmful\nemissions, national regulations)</li>\n\n<li>Technical Instructions for Avoiding Air Pollution</li>\n\n<li>Waste Water Discharge Law</li>\n\n<li>Waste Disposal Law</li>\n\n<li>Waste Resources Law</li>\n\n<li>Materials Regulations</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  \r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td ></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
