    <b>Trouble Code Features</b><br>In a few cases, the diagnostic tester may display a trouble code status or description that looks unfamiliar:<br><br>Trouble Code Status:<br>Instead of the known PRESENT, NOT PRESENT (and INTERMITTENT) message, you may read UNKNOWN DTC in the tester display. This tells you that the diagnostic software or control unit contains a piece of incorrect information that is unknown to the diagnostic tester and that it is unable to read or evaluate. Both the trouble code number and the trouble code text are not changed in this case.<br><br>The above mentioned special cases can not be removed by means of a diagnostic tester function.

    <b>Service-Programming SPS</b><br>The new FLASH-Programming makes it possible to cover different software variants with one hardware version of a control unit. Depending on the system calibration values, curves and mappings can be programmed into a specific control unit type.<br>In order to program those specific vehicle data into the control unit, you need a diagnostic tester and a TIS (TECH Information-System) unit. Up to now, that could only be done by replacing the program memory (EPROM) or even the complete control unit.<br>The newest programming data is published with the TIS CD.<br>Programming Procedure:<br>Connect the diagnostic tester to the vehicle diagnostic connector.<br>Start the SPS service programming application.<br>Download vehicle data and security access from control unit to diagnostic tester.<br>Connect diagnostic tester to TIS.<br>Upload vehicle data and security access from diagnostic tester to TECH Information-System (TIS) .<br>TIS checks the security access and compares the vehicle data with the data stored on the TIS CD.<br>If the security check fails, TIS cannot automatically select the relevant programming data. In case of a failure, TIS requests all information (e.g. vehicle identification number, system name) required in order to select the appropriate system software. For further information please refer to the SPS manual.<br>If the security check is passed, the data selected by TIS will be copied from the CD to the diagnostic tester.<br>Connect the diagnostic tester with the required program copy to the vehicle.<br>The program download to the control unit is executed.<br>The SPS service programming procedure is completed, the diagnostic tester recognises whether the data has been properly transferred or not.<br>The diagnostic tester is the interface between the storage device TIS and the control unit to be programmed. A direct connection between TIS and control unit is not possible.<br>The diagnostic tester is the interface between the storage device (TIS with latest TIS-CD) and the control unit to be programmed. A direct connection between TIS and control unit is not possible.<br>
    <b>Note:</b><br>After service programming the control unit must be labelled with the current calibration identifier.
