<p class="title">Track</p>

<p>The distance between wheel centre planes of an axle is the
track. On twin tyres, it is measured from the centre of the twin
wheel to the centre of the twin wheel.</p>

<p>The track affects the cornering behaviour of the vehicle. A
large track allows a higher speed on corners.</p>

<p>For individual suspension with transverse or semi-trailing arms,
the track changes on spring compression and extension. This
increases the rolling resistance and tyre wear. If the track
changes too much, e.g. due to work control arm bushes or faulty
steering joints, the straight-ahead steering behaviour of the
vehicle deteriorates.</p>
