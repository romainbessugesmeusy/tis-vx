<p class="title">Requirements at the measurement point</p>

<p>The measurement point must meet certain requirements to allow
precise alignment and setting. The reproducibility of measurement
values is also ensured in this way.</p>

<p>It is very important that the wheel contact points of the
measurement plate are height-aligned to each other. This is usually
checked with a visual levelling device.</p>

<p>The permitted height difference between the left and right side
is max. 1 mm, between front and rear and diagonal max. 2 mm. The
lift must be adjustable in three working heights with this
dimensional accuracy.</p>
