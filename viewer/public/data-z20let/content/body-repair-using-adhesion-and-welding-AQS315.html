<p class="title">Body Repair Using Adhesion And Welding</p>

<p>The nature of the construction of the Speedster body and chassis
preclude it from the normal Opel methods and procedures for repair.
It is not permissible to weld any of the aluminium parts of the
vehicle, construction is made from preformed parts which are
mechanically bonded using special heat cured adhesives. If any
parts of the partial body shell are damaged severely enough to
warrant replacement then the partial body shell should be replaced.
Adhesives are used only in limited areas, glass, grilles etc. as
well as bonding fibreglass components to the aluminium partial body
shell. Normal workshop practice is appropriate in this application.
Body repairs using normal fibreglass techniques is permissible in
most areas.</p>
