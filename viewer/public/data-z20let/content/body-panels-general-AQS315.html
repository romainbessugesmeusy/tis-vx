The major panels are manufactured by a vacuum assisted resin  injection process and are nominall 2 mm thick.  The actual thickness of the  panels is varied, according to the load to be carried, providing an optimum  panel for high strength and low weight.  The body panels do not corrode,  therefore, the strength of the panels does not reduce with age.  The external  panels make no significant contribution to the rigidity of the chassis.   &nbsp;</FONT><P  ><FONT STYLE="font-size: 12pt; "> The outer surface of the body panels is sealed with a thin layer of gel-coat resin, which forms a smooth base for the paint.   &nbsp;</FONT><P  ><FONT STYLE="font-size: 12pt; "> The glassfibre composite material will absorb high impact loads, such as in a  crash, by collapsing in a progressive manner.  This feature helps protect the  occupants from injurious shock loads and reduces the possibility of entrapment,  which can occur with the deformation of a steel panel.   &nbsp;</FONT><P  ><FONT STYLE="font-size: 12pt; "> The body panels must not be subjected to excessive deflecting; the gel-coat resin can crack.  These cracks can take up to 3 months to become  visible.  Do not sit, or lean heavily on the body panels.   &nbsp;</FONT><P  ><FONT STYLE="font-size: 12pt;font-weight: bold; ">• Service &nbsp;</FONT><P  ><FONT STYLE="font-size: 12pt; "> A one component glue (Part no. 15 04 811) is used for bonding body parts.   &nbsp;</FONT><P  ><FONT STYLE="font-size: 12pt; "> Repairs to the body comprise replacement of the body panel, or replacement of  the damaged area with a replacement section.     &nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
