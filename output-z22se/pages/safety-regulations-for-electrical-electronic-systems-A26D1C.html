<p class="title">Safety Regulations for Electrical/Electronic
Systems</p>

<p class="topic">9.1 General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Never touch high-voltage-bearing components (e.g.: ignition
system, xenon lamps) &ndash; can be fatal.</li>

<li>Before disconnecting the ground cable from the battery in
vehicles with alarm system and power sounder, disarm the power
sounder. Disconnect the ground cable from the battery within 15
seconds of switching off the ignition.</li>

<li>If an alarm is unintentionally triggered via the power sounder,
switch on the ignition (battery connected) in order to override the
alarm.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">9.2 General Repair Information</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>When performing work where there is a danger of an electrical
short circuit, disconnect the earth cable from the battery. The
following procedure must be observed to avoid injury to persons and
damage to sensitive electrical components:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>The battery terminals must be covered so that accidental
contact does not occur because the battery cable has gradually
moved backwards. This also prevents accidental contact during
assembly, e.g. with bright metal components or tools.</li>

<li>If individual connection cables forming part of the battery
connection have to be dismantled, always remove the earth clip on
the battery terminal first so that all the power circuits on the
vehicle are free from voltage. Non-adherence to this ruling can
lead to electronic components being damaged. Reconnection takes
place in reverse order, the earth clip is the last to be connected
to the battery.</li>
</ul>

<li>Never connect/disconnect control unit or miscellaneous
electronic component wiring harness plugs with the ignition
switched on to avoid damaging the control units.</li>

<li>Never pull on cable when disconnecting wiring harness plugs.
Carefully release locking mechanism at wiring harness plug.</li>

<li>When cleaning and contact sprays are being used, the
manufacturer's recommendations must be followed. Improper use can
damage sensitive electrical and electronic components.</li>

<li>When returning a unit containing a CD unit (e.g. navigation
control unit, CD changer), remove all CD's to avoid damage to the
laser head or CD.</li>

<li>To charge the battery, use a battery charger approved by
Service.</li>

<li>When programming the control unit memory system, ensure that no
persons are present in the interior - risk of injury!</li>

<li>After completing repair operations, ensure that wiring harness
connections and battery connections are correctly seated and that
ground connections have been made correctly. Defective electrical
connections cause functional problems and destroy control
units.</li>

<li>Wiring harnesses and wiring troughs which are released or
removed during repair work must be refastened in their original
positions using genuine Aftersales parts (cable ties, clips, wiring
trough brackets, etc.).</li>

<li>Disconnecting the ground cable from the battery automatically
erases the contents of certain electronic system memories (e.g.
electric window winder, time and date). After reconnecting the
ground cable to the battery, these volatile memories must be
reprogrammed and audio equipment decoded.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Only Corsa-C as of Model Year 2004 and Meriva-A: In vehicles
with ESP, the steering angle sensor must be recalibrated after
disconnecting the battery - switch ignition ON and turn steering
wheel from the right to the left stop.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p class="topic">9.3 Wiring Harness Repair</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Wiring harness repairs must be performed by certified,
qualified personnel only. This is assured at all Opel/Vauxhall
affiliated dealerships.</li>

<li>Cables or wiring harness plugs may only be repaired using the
methods described in the service literature and using the special
tools and spares specified. Deviations may be made from this rule
in individual cases, e.g. in the course of roadside
assistance.</li>

<li>When repairing non-approved systems or wiring harnesses:</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Shielded cables/coaxial cables e.g. for the ABS system/ ASC
system, radio, telephone, engine, alarm system. An exception to
this rule are CAN-bus cables, which can be repaired in accordance
with KTA-1950/2, section D6.</li>

<li>Airbag and pyrotechnic seat belt tensioner system</li>

<li>Electronically controlled throttle valve</li>

<li>Electric power steering system</li>

<li>Electrical seat adjustment</li>

<li>High-voltage-bearing cables (e.g. ignition system, xenon
lamp)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p class="topic">9.4 Vehicle Battery</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Fluid-filled vehicle batteries must only be stored and charged
in well-ventilated areas. Gaseous hydrogen released when the
battery is charged is lighter than air and combines with air to
form an explosive mixture. Avoid the formation of sparks, smoking
and naked flames.</li>

<li>If, on batteries fitted with a "magic eye", this is colourless
or light yellow, the acid level is too low and overheating may
occur during recharging &ndash; danger of explosion. Only charge
undamaged batteries.</li>

<li>To charge the battery, use a battery charger approved by
Service.</li>

<li>The recommended battery acid temperature during charging is
between 10 &deg;C/50 &deg;F and 30 &deg;C/86 &deg;F. Reduce the
charging current if the temperature exceeds 50 &deg;C/122 &deg;F
and terminate charging if it exceeds 55 &deg;C/131 &deg;F. The
battery cannot be charged at temperatures below 0 &deg;C/32 &deg;F.
The temperature of the battery acid can be estimated from the
temperature of the battery casing.</li>

<li>Electrolyte (sulphuric acid) escaping from vehicle batteries
can lead to serious acid burns &ndash; danger of injury. Escaping
electrolyte must be diluted and flushed away using large volumes of
water, soaked up with sawdust or with an absorbent cloth.</li>

<li>Due to the quiescent current of control units (e.g. ATWS, radio
units), the battery may become discharged during long standing
periods (e.g. stored vehicles) &ndash; disconnect battery and
recharge if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">9.5 Diagnosis</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>For testing purposes, use only a high-resistivity voltage
tester.</li>

<li>The pyrotechnic system (e.g. airbag) may only be tested using
the diagnostic tester. In order to prevent unintentional
deployment, never use a test lamp or multimeter to perform
measurements on the pyrotechnic units &ndash; danger of
injury.</li>

<li>The test operations during which wiring harness plug contacts
or control units are connected to ground or the battery voltage
(+12 V) must be performed with extreme care and concentration. A
wrong contact can destroy internal circuits in the relevant control
units.</li>

<li>The battery must be in good condition and adequately charged
when performing diagnosis on electrical/electronic systems.</li>

<li>Only suitable test probes may be used for measuring so as to
avoid damage to the contacts.</li>
