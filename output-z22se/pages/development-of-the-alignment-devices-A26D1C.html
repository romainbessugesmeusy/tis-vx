<p class="title">Development of the alignment devices</p>

<p>Chassis alignments and hence the chassis alignment equipment, is
as old as the cars themselves. In the beginning, the position of
the wheels was determined using plumb lines, level gauges and
measurement plates. Obviously, these measurement methods produced
very imprecise information on the wheel position, but this was
adequate for the earlier rigid axles with steering knuckles and
steering knuckle pins.</p>

<p>Further development of the chassis designs right up to the
modern multi-link suspension systems means it is now possible to
determine the chassis geometry precisely, including rear axle
alignment. This development has resulted in increased
specifications chassis alignment equipment in order to be able to
perform satisfactory chassis alignment checks.</p>

<p>For modern individual suspension, the mechanical and visual
measurement methods are no longer adequate for precise chassis
alignment and have not been approved by Opel/Vauxhall for all
Opel/Vauxhall vehicles since the introduction of the Vectra-B. They
have been replaced by the modern computer-supported chassis
alignment systems.</p>

<p>Computer-aided chassis alignments equipment not only permit very
precise chassis alignments, they also save a lot of time.</p>
