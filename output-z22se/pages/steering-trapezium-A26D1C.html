<p class="title">Steering trapezium</p>

<p>The steering trapezium shows how the various steering angles are
formed when cornering. A well set-up trapezium prevents the wheels
slipping.</p>

<p>Front axle, control arms and tie-rods form the steering
trapezium.</p>

<p>In straight-ahead position, the tie-rods are parallel to the
front axle.</p>

<p>On cornering, the stub axles must be deflected. The stub axles
and control arms are not arranged at 90&deg; angles. Because of the
arrangement, the tie-rods are no longer parallel to the front axle
when the stub axles are deflected. This gives uneven travel at the
ends of the two control arms which leads to the wheels being at
different angles (see also toe variation).</p>
