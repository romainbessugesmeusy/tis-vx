<p class="title">Oil Consumption, Measure (Z 22 SE, Z 20 LET)</p>

<p class="topic">General</p>

<p>The oil consumption of a combustion engine represents the amount
of oil burned by the engine during operation. A clear distinction
should be made between oil consumption and oil loss caused by leaks
at the oil pan, cylinder head etc.</p>

<p class="para-before-list">The purpose of the engine oil is
to:</p>

<td class="list--arabic--number" width="20">1.</td>
<td colspan="3">separate surfaces that slide on one another with an
oil film, i.e. prevent dry friction.</td>

<p>These tasks require a certain amount of oil consumption, and
accordingly the expectation that progress made in the development
of combustion engines will one day lead to an engine which does not
consume any oil at all is unfounded. The oil consumption depends on
the operating conditions, the driving style and the production
tolerances. Under normal conditions the oil consumption is so low
that no or barely any oil needs to be added between the specified
oil changes. However, it is essential that oil is added if the oil
level drops below the "MIN" mark on the dipstick. It is also
extremely important to ensure that the oil level does not exceed
the "MAX" mark, as this would cause excessive oil consumption.</p>

<p>As the oil consumption is due to technical factors, the correct
interpretation of apparent non&ndash;consumption of oil by an
engine is that the oil is being diluted as a result of specific
operating conditions. Frequent cold starts, driving with a cold
engine etc. cause the oil flowing back to the oil pan to carry
non&ndash;volatile fuel components and condensation products. These
dilute the oil and lead to the incorrect assumption that the engine
is not consuming any oil at all.</p>

<p>Oil which has become diluted in this way loses its lubricating
properties and can eventually lead to engine damage if the
specified oil change intervals are not adhered to. The main causes
for oil dilution are: driving the vehicle mostly in urban traffic
and frequent driving at low engine speeds with a cold engine.</p>

<p>As the oil consumption does not stabilise until after a few
thousand kilometres, oil consumption measurements do not yield
realistic results until the vehicle has covered approx. 7500 km.
Before measuring the oil consumption it is important to check that
the engine is not losing oil as a result of leaks.</p>

<p><span class="gt-notice">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The oil
dipstick only performs a checking function and cannot be used for
the measurement. The engine must always be switched off for at
least 2 minutes before checking the oil level. If after an oil
change the maximum engine oil filling does not correspond to the
maximum level on the oil dipstick, this can be explained with the
production tolerances.</p>

<p>All information regarding the permissible engine oil consumption
and filling quantities is included in the Owner's Guide.</p>
