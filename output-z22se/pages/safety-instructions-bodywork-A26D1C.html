<p class="title">Safety Instructions, Bodywork</p>

<p class="topic">General</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>All operations are shown mainly by diagrams. Explanatory text
is included only where it is important for specialist repairs
affecting the vehicle structure.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="none" class="none">
<li>The sequence of figures which include instructions for the
working procedure reflect the sequence of operations. Repeated
standard operations such as separation work or grinding down joint
surfaces are not especially described, because this work is routine
workshop practice.</li>

<li>In regions where both the separation and also the connection
affect the strength and road safety of the bodywork, the repair
methods described in this section must be adhered to.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">Repair Information &ndash; Preparatory Work</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>The locally applicable state laws and regulations must always
be observed when cutting or working with materials.</li>

<li>Make sure that there is suitable extraction of vapour and
particles during all cutting, grinding and welding work.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Always wear protective goggles and a filter mask when cutting
or grinding.</li>

<li>Fire Hazard &ndash; Observe the instructions on the containers
when storing substances containing solvents.</li>

<li>Fire and naked lights are forbidden.</li>

<li>There must be enough fire extinguishers available, and they
must have been serviced regularly.</li>

<li>Environmental and Health and Safety regulations must always be
observed.</li>

<li>Because of the fire risk, protective sealants must not be
applied to the area of the engine or exhaust system (e.g. catalytic
converter, oxygen sensors).</li>

<li>In the case of accidents which indicate a high degree of stress
to the chassis, irrespective of any measurement of the axle
geometry which has to be carried out, the following components must
be specifically checked:</li>
</ul>

<ul type="none" class="none">
<li>steering and steering linkages for perfect operation from
full&ndash;lock to full&ndash;lock. Visual inspection for bending
or cracks.</li>

<li>Chassis and all chassis parts such as spring struts, steering
knuckles, pull rods, axle bodies, stabilisers and their fastening
parts, for bends and cracks.</li>

<li>Rims and tyres for damage, cuts in tread and sides, running
true and balance.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>All components removed or detached during repair work must be
re&ndash;tightened in their original positions. Damaged components
(e.g. micro&ndash;encapsulated bolts) must be replaced by new
components.</li>

<li>The battery ground cable must be disconnected for any work
where there is a danger of an electrical short&ndash;circuit.</li>

<li>Electronic control units may be damaged at temperatures above
<span class="tech-spec">80 &deg;C/176 &deg;F</span> .</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">Safety instruction, body panels</p>

<p>Sitting on body panels or distorting them in any other way is
not permitted.</p>

<p>Body panels must not be excessively distorted, otherwise the gel
coat may split. These splits may only become visible after three
months.</p>

<p>The outer surfaces of panels are sealed with a thin layer of
synthetic resin, which provides a smooth base for paint
application.</p>
