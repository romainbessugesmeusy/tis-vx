<p class="title">Safety regulations &ndash; engine, fuel and
exhaust system</p>

<p class="topic">6.1 General &ndash; Engine</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Observe the relevant environmental, health and work safety
regulations regarding explosive and flammable materials.</li>

<li>Refrigerant vapours are heavier than air (in high
concentrations) &ndash; danger of suffocation.</li>

<li>Refrigerant constitutes a health hazard if swallowed.</li>

<li>During all operations in the engine compartment, remember that
the ventilator can switch on - risk of injury!</li>

<li>The fuel system, including the fuel lines, must not be opened
while the engine is running. Risk of fatal injury!</li>

<li>Never touch high-voltage live components (e.g. ignition system)
with the engine running is prohibited &ndash; can be fatal.</li>

<li>Before all operations involving a risk of electrical short
circuit, the ground cable must be disconnected from the battery.
This also applies if electrical welding is performed on the
vehicle.</li>

<li>Before disconnecting the ground cable from the battery in
vehicles with alarm system and power sounder, disarm the power
sounder. Disconnect the ground cable from the battery within 15
seconds of switching off the ignition.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">6.2 Repair Information &ndash; Engine</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Disconnecting the ground cable from the battery automatically
erases the contents of certain electronic system memories (e.g.
electric window winder, time and date). After reconnecting the
ground cable to the battery, these volatile memories must be
reprogrammed and audio equipment decoded.</li>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Only Corsa-C as of Model Year 2004 and Meriva-A: In vehicles
with ESP, the steering angle sensor must be recalibrated after
disconnecting the battery - switch ignition ON and turn steering
wheel from the right to the left stop.</li>
</ul>

<li>Disconnect the battery from the on-board power supply before
charging or rapid charging. Never start the vehicle using a rapid
charger.</li>

<li>Ensure correct seating of battery terminals.</li>

<li>Wiring harnesses and wiring troughs which are released or
removed during repair work must be refastened in their original
positions using genuine Aftersales parts (cable ties, clips, wiring
trough brackets, etc.).</li>

<li>During removal/installation of engine or transmission, it must
be ensured that all ground connections are correctly routed. Poor
ground connections lead to malfunctions in the system and, in
extreme cases, to the destruction of control units. Never
connect/disconnect control unit or miscellaneous electronic
component wiring harness plugs with the ignition switched on.</li>

<li>When mounting components in a vice, always use protective jaws
made of soft metal.</li>

<li>The thread of screw connections that have been used with
sealing compound must be recut. Coat screws with sealing compound
before use.</li>

<li>When replacing microencapsulated self-locking screws, there is
no need for the use of additional locking compounds when
installing.</li>

<li>Check all components for signs of wear and replace if
necessary.</li>

<li>Place removed components on clean surfaces only and cover with
foil &ndash; never use lint-producing cloths. If repairs cannot be
carried out immediately, seal open components or cover them
carefully. Only install clean parts. Remove new parts from their
packaging immediately prior to installation.</li>

<li>To prevent damage to toothed-belt fabric, ensure that toothed
belt does not come into contact with coolant.</li>

<li>The components of the engine are sensitive to shock and must
not be installed if damaged. This applies in particular to the
throttle valve body as severe malfunctions may be result if
damaged, e.g. by being dropped.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">6.3 Repair instructions - high-pressure and direct
injection systems (petrol and diesel engines)</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Always wear safety glasses.</li>

<li>Extremely high pressure (up to 2000 bar) is present at the high
pressure system connections. Before opening or carrying out any
operation on the high pressure system, ensure that the lines are
not pressurised.</li>

<li>Lines must not be opened or released when the engine is
running.</li>

<li>When installing used or new high pressure system components,
existing seals must be renewed (e.g. injectors).</li>

<li>Before opening the high-pressure fuel system, disconnect
battery and ensure that the high-pressure fuel system has
depressurized.</li>

<li>Always check for leaks after opening the high-pressure
system.</li>

<li>The system is extremely sensitive to contamination. Dirt
particles cause functional impairment, damage and destruction of
the high pressure injection system. Furthermore, wearing of other
components may occur. Thus, utmost cleanliness must be ensured for
operations on the fuel injection system.</li>

<li>All fuel lines must be tightened to the specified torque.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">6.4 General &ndash; Fuel System</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Observe the relevant environmental, health and work safety
regulations regarding explosive and flammable materials.</li>

<li>Never drain fuel tanks over workshop pits. Fuel vapours settle
at the bottom of the pit &ndash; danger of suffocation. Work on
lifting ramps in adequately ventilated areas only.</li>

<li>During all operations in the engine compartment, remember that
the ventilator can switch on - risk of injury!</li>

<li>Never touch high-voltage live components (e.g. ignition system,
xenon lamp) &ndash; can be fatal.</li>

<li>Before operations involving a risk of electrical short circuit,
the ground cable must be disconnected from the battery. This also
applies if electrical welding is performed on the vehicle.</li>

<li>Before disconnecting the ground cable from the battery in
vehicles with alarm system and power sounder, disarm the power
sounder. Disconnect the ground cable from the battery within 15
seconds of switching off the ignition.</li>

<li>Appropriate warning signs must be set up during operations on
the fuel tank.</li>

<li>Keep away from flames and naked lights when working on the fuel
system and avoid ignition sources and sparks.</li>

<li>Never fasten fuel lines to brake lines, movable components or
sharp edges. Never fasten wiring to fuel lines.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">6.5 General Repair Information &ndash; Fuel
System</p>

<p><span class="gt-important">Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> When
working on the fuel system, ensure that any escaping fuel is
captured in suitable containers. Ensure that no engine or vehicle
components come into contact with escaping fuel. Dispose of escaped
fuel immediately and clean contaminated components.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Reduce fuel pressure via test connector on fuel pressure gauge
and collect escaping fuel in suitable container.</li>

<li>Drain fuel tank using fuel refilling unit &ndash; see
"Opel/Vauxhall Workshop Equipment" catalogue. Store drained fuel in
suitable, sealable containers.</li>

<li>The utmost cleanliness is important when working on the open
fuel system.</li>

<li>Use special tool to change fuel filter &ndash; see "Special
Tools" catalogue.</li>

<li>Before removing fuel system components, thoroughly clean
connections and their immediate vicinity. After detaching, the fuel
lines must be securely sealed using the appropriate special service
tool.</li>

<li>Check that fuel and vacuum lines are correctly routed and
firmly attached. Avoid chafing.</li>

<li>When installing fuel lines, ensure that they are not twisted or
pinched. Fuel lines must not be kinked.</li>

<li>If repairs cannot be carried out immediately, seal open
components or cover them carefully.</li>

<li>Check fuel system for leaks &ndash; escaping fuel must be
disposed of immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p class="topic">6.6 General Repair Information &ndash; Exhaust
System</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Leaks (dead air) in the intake and exhaust system upstream from
the catalytic converter result in incorrect oxygen sensor
measurements.</li>

<li>Exercise utmost care during all operations on the secondary air
system. Any leak in the secondary air system can cause damage to
the catalytic converter and/or engine.</li>

<li>Protect oxygen sensor from effects of silicon.</li>

<li>Do not clean the oxygen sensor with fuel or allow it to come
into contact with fuel.</li>

<li>When re-using oxygen sensor, coat thread with special grease.
The thread of new oxygen sensors is already coated with special
grease.</li>

<li>Install the exhaust system free of tension and aligned
according to the contours of the vehicle underbody.</li>

<li>Check exhaust system for leaks.</li>

<li>When replacing the exhaust system or individual components, use
vehicle-approved parts only.</li>

<li>Take necessary precautions when working on hot exhaust systems
&ndash; danger of burning.</li>

<li>When removing parts or the entire exhaust system, ensure that
the flexible pipe is not deflected by an angle exceeding 10&deg;.
Suspend front exhaust pipe from underbody using suitable means when
performing removal operations if necessary.</li>
