<p class="title">Geometric driving axis</p>

<p>The rear axle decides the tracking axle of the vehicle.
Therefore all measurements on the front wheels relate to the
geometric driving axis. The vehicle drives "straight ahead" on the
geometric driving axis.</p>

<table border="0">

<td valign="top" width="95%">
<p>The geometric driving axis (1) arises from the bisectors of the
total toe (4) of the rear wheels. It is therefore determined by the
toe variation of the rear wheels divided by two.</p>

<p>The diagram shows the ideal case. The axis of symmetry and the
geometric driving axis coincide. The individual toe values (2, 3)
of the rear wheels in this case have the same positive value, e.g.
rear left/right +0&deg; 10'. But this ideal case also applies with
the same negative value.</p>

<p>If these axes deviate outside the tolerance given by
Opel/Vauxhall, the toe of the rear wheels must be adjusted. If the
toe cannot be adjusted, the rear axle must be adjusted or aligned
using the corresponding special tool.</p>

<p>If adjustment/setting as specified is not possible, the rear
axle body must be replaced or the fixing points of the rear axle
checked for damage on the vehicle subframe.</p>

<p>An anti-clockwise deviation of the geometric driving axis
("pulling" to the left) results in a negative and a clockwise
deviation ("pulling" to the right) produces a positive angle.</p>

<p>During electronic chassis alignments, the geometric driving axis
is automatically determined as a reference line for the toe
measurements on the front wheels. The reference measurement is a
vital requirement for correct measurements on modern Opel/Vauxhall
vehicles.</p>
